Shiitake and lemongrass noodle broth
Introduction:
This health-giving, aromatic vegetarian noodle broth calls for quite a few ingredients but can be put together in moments. Use the lower, softer yellow part of the lemongrass stalk in this recipe. Shiitake mushrooms have a lovely slightly nutty flavour, but if you can't get hold of them, use ordinary mushrooms instead. The mushrooms give a full, meaty texture to this broth, but if you have any cooked chicken you could shred that and add it as well. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp groundnut or sunflower oil 2 large or 4 small shallots, finely sliced 4-5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped or grated 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 lemongrass stalks, outer 1-2 leaves removed & tough upper green stalk discarded, lower yellow stalk finely sliced 2 medium-hot chillies, thinly sliced into rounds & seeds discarded 800ml veg stock 400ml tin coconut milk 1 red pepper, deseeded & thinly sliced 150g shiitake mushrooms, cleaned & finely sliced 1 tbsp soy sauce, more to taste juice of 1 large lime, to taste 150g rice noodles 4 spring onions, sliced into thin rounds handful fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped handful fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the shallots, ginger and garlic and fry on a low to medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the lemongrass and chillies and fry for another minute. Stir in the stock and coconut milk. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the pepper and simmer for another 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 2 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce and lime juice to taste. While the broth is simmering, cook the rice noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain and divide between 4 bowls.
