Leek and Parma ham fritters
Introduction:
Delicate, salty Parma ham sets the sweetness of the leeks off to perfection. This recipe makes a great starter or side dish. It's good both warm and cold. 
Ingredients:
4 leeks 20g butter 5 tbsp white wine 8 slices Parma ham 2 eggs, beaten with 1 tbsp milk 125g fresh breadcrumbs 120ml olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Trim the leeks, then wash and cut in half lengthways. Place in a shallow ovenproof dish, dot with butter, pour over the wine and season well. Cover tightly with foil and bake in the oven until the leeks are just tender. Allow to cool, then drain and dry on kitchen roll. Wrap each piece of leek in Parma ham. Dip in the beaten egg, then in the breadcrumbs until well coated. Repeat with all the leeks. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the leeks over a moderate heat until crisp and golden brown. Drain and serve.
