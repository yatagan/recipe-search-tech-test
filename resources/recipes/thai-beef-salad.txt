Thai beef salad
Introduction:
Frying steak needs to be tenderised with a few taps with a rolling pin and BBQâ€™d quickly; the secret with this cut is not to let it rest as it tends to toughen up so onto a chopping board, cut into manageable pieces and straight into the bap is the way to go. Brushing with soya sauce while cooking will give a slight teriyaki taste...or try this salad. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp lime juice 1 tbsp fish sauce 1 tbsp dark palm sugar, finely chopped (or any brown sugar) 2 tsp sesame oil 2 tsp fresh ginger, finely grated 1 garlic clove, crushed 3 tsp soy sauce 600g frying steak 200g cherry tomatoes, halved 1 cucumber, halved lengthways & thinly sliced diagonally 1 red onion, halved & cut into thin wedges 2 long fresh red chillies, halved, deseeded & thinly sliced lengthways 1 bunch each fresh mint, coriander & basil, leaves picked & large leaves torn 50g toasted peanuts or cashews, chopped 4 kaffir lime leaves, centre veins removed, finely shredded
Method:
Make the dressing: whisk together lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce in a jug. Cook the steak over a high heat for 2 minutes each side, brushing with the remaining soy sauce. Put the tomato, cucumber, onion, chilli, mint, coriander, basil, peanuts and lime leaves in a large bowl. Add the sliced steak and dressing.
