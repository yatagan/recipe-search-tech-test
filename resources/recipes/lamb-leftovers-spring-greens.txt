Lamb leftovers with spring greens 
Introduction:
A great way to use up the remainders of your Sunday lamb roast. Serve with a dal to make it into a full meal. 
Ingredients:
400g spring/summer greens, shredded 30g butter 150g cooked lamb (plus stuffing), cut into thick matchsticks
Method:
Shred the greens, stalks and all, chopping the stalks finer than the leaves. Cook slowly in a tightly lidded saucepan with a little water, for 10-15 minutes until al dente, stirring occasionally. Add the butter, stir around until melted and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the lamb. Continue to cook, gently stirring until everything is mixed together and hot. Serve immediately.
