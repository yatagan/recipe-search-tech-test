Smashed kohlrabi, apple & cider
Introduction:
Kohlrabi will never mash into a smooth purée, so embrace this fact by giving in to a bit of texture and unevenness. Call it rustic if you like.
Ingredients:
1 apple, peeled & chopped 1 kohlrabi, peeled & chopped into small dice 125ml cider (we used Ashridge) ½ tsp cider vinegar 30g butter good pinch allspice 1 tbsp honey 1 tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Put the apple, kohlrabi, cider, vinegar, butter and allspice in a pan, with just enough water to cover. Bring to the boil and simmer for about 25 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated and everything is tender (top up with a little more water if it dries out). Turn up the heat to reduce it if you need to. Add the honey and mustard and lightly smash with a fork or masher. Season to taste.
