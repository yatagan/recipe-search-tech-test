Twice-cooked belly pork with spring onions and ginger
Introduction:
This is a wonderful way of cooking a cheap cut of meat: the pork belly is boiled to tenderise, then stir-fried with ginger, spring onions and an Asian sauce. This is lovely with fluffy basmati rice and steamed greens - try French beans, pak choi, broccoli or chard. 
Ingredients:
1kg belly pork, cut into slices 2cm thick 1 bunch spring onions, chopped (reserve the green tops) 2cm fresh ginger, chopped (reserve the trimmings) 1 tbsp sunflower oil 1 garlic clove, chopped 2 tbsp oyster sauce 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp coriander (optional)
Method:
Put the pork belly in a pan and add enough water just to cover, plus the green ends from the spring onions and the trimmings from the ginger. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer very gently for 1 hour or until the pork is tender (this can be done well ahead of time). Remove the pork from the pan, reserving the cooking liquor, and allow to cool. Slice the pork thinly width ways. When you are ready to serve, heat the oil in a large frying pan until very hot, add the pork pieces and cook for about 10 minutes over a high heat, stirring constantly, until browned all over. The pork will disintegrate slightly and start to stick, but keep stirring and scraping the pan with a wooden spoon. When the pork is slightly shredded, brown and crisp, add the chopped garlic and ginger and stir for 1 minute. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce and spring onions and mix well, adding a little of the reserved cooking liquor for a moister result. Stir in the coriander, if using, and serve.
