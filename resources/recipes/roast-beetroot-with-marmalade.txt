Roast beetroot with marmalade
Introduction:
The bitter sweet taste of the marmalade and the mellow earthiness of the beetroot combine beautifully. Goes well in a salad, or with roasted pork or chicken. 
Ingredients:
500g beetroot 1 tbsp marmalade 50g butter
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Put the beetroot in a baking dish containing about 5mm water, cover with foil and roast in a moderately hot oven for about 45 minutes, until tender. Peel and cut them into wedges, then toss with the marmalade, butter and some salt and pepper. Return to a hot oven for 5 minutes or until glazed and heated through.
