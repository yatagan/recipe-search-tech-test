Sesame spring greens
Introduction:
Full of vitamins and folic acid, spring greens are the welcome herald of a change of season. The easiest way to shred them is to make a pile of leaves with the tough stalks removed, roll them up together lengthways, then chop. This quick, punchy vegetarian recipe also works really well with purple sprouting broccoli or cabbage. 
Ingredients:
2 heads spring greens, shredded 1 bunch spring onions, finely chopped for the dressing: 3 tbsp groundnut oil (or sunflower) 2 tbsp water 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 pinch cayenne pepper
Method:
Blanch the greens in boiling, salted water for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh. Make the dressing by whisking together the remaining ingredients, add to the greens and toss. Sprinkle with spring onions to serve.
