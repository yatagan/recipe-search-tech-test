Javanese spinach soup with sweetcorn
Introduction:
This is a quick, healthy and comforting weekday staple. It could be made with tofu instead of sweetcorn. It's a lovely starter, or a main course with steamed rice. If you'd prefer it vegetarian, substitute the chicken for vegetable stock. 
Ingredients:
750ml chicken stock 1 onion, chopped 1cm fresh galangal or ginger, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced Â¼ tsp turmeric 1 fresh or dried salam leaf (if unavailable, use bay leaf) 1 tsp brown sugar 125g fresh corn kernels 300g spinach, washed & roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the chicken stock, onion, galangal, garlic, turmeric, salam leaf and brown sugar in a large pan and simmer for 5 minutes, covered. Add the corn and simmer for 7 minutes, partially covered, until the corn is tender. Add the spinach and season to taste. Serve with rice.
