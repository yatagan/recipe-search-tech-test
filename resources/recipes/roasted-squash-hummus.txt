Roasted squash hummus
Introduction:
A simple recipe for a creamy, healthy hummus. Eat at room temperature with flatbread, or spread in a pitta as an alternative to chickpea hummus. The recipe would work with most varieties of small squash e.g. sweet mama, and also with sweet potatoes. Stir in a little harissa if you'd like things spicy. 
Ingredients:
1 butternut or other small squash e.g. sweet mama, split in half & deseeded juice of 1 lemon 1 large garlic clove 2 tbsp tahini handful pine nuts, toasted olive oil to drizzle salt & pepper
Method:
Roast the squash in a hot oven 200Â°C/Gas 6 for 30 minutes or until very tender and soft. Scrape the flesh from the skin into a food processor, add the lemon juice (you may need extra depending on taste), garlic, tahini, salt and pepper. Blitz until a smooth mixture is formed. Check the seasoning. Place in a small bowl with the toasted pinenuts scattered over and drizzled with the olive oil. Serve with warmed or toasted flatbread.
