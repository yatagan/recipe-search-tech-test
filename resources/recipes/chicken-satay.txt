Chicken satay
Introduction:
A delicious saucy kebab. Serve with rice, or on their own with sauce spooned over for a delectable starter. 
Ingredients:
for the chicken: 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1.5cm fresh ginger, grated 2 tbsp lemongrass, finely chopped 1 tsp turmeric 1 tbsp vegetable oil 2 tbsp soy sauce 300g diced chicken salt & pepper for the sauce: 2 chillies, seeded & finely chopped 5 shallots, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped Â½ tsp shrimp paste 1 tbsp sunflower oil 150ml coconut milk 2 tbsp palm sugar 150g unsalted peanuts, roasted & pulsed in a food processor 2 tsp soy sauce 1 lime, juiced
Method:
For the marinade, mix the garlic, ginger, lemongrass and turmeric to a rough paste in the small bowl of a food processor, along with plenty of black pepper. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the oil and soy sauce. Add the chicken to the marinade, mixing well. Cover, refrigerate and marinade for an hour or so. Soak four wooden skewers in cold water. Next make the sauce. Put the chillies, shallots, garlic and shrimp paste in a pestle and mortar or food processor, and blitz to a paste with the oil. Fry the paste for a couple of minutes, add the coconut milk and palm sugar and simmer briefly, then add the peanuts and simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Stir in the soy sauce and lime juice, and a little water or coconut milk if it seems too thick. Check the flavour and assemble your skewers, ensuring they are not too tight, so the heat can get to the entire surface. Cook on a BBQ, or a griddle pan over a medium-high heat until cooked through, turning regularly. You can turn the heat down to medium on the griddle once the skewers are well-charred.
