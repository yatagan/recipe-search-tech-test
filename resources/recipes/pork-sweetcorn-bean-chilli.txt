Pork, sweetcorn and bean chilli with roasted squash
Introduction:
Tender roasted squash halves filled with a spicy mixture of pork mince and beans. The tomato purée and dark chocolate add a wonderful richness to this impressive, Mexican-style dinner. You can also use beef rather than pork mince. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. sunflower 1 onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 400g pork mince 2 red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped leaves of 4 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1 tsp dried 15g fresh coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves kept separate 1 tbsp tomato purée 2 tsp cumin seeds, toasted & ground 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tin chopped tomatoes 2 small squares Montezuma dark chocolate 2 small squash, cut in half lengthways 2 sweetcorn cobs, kernels removed 1 tin black beans or kidney beans, rinsed & drained 1 pot Greek yoghurt 1 lime, finely grated zest & juice
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onion and fry gently for 8 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the garlic, pork, chillies, thyme leaves and coriander stalks. Turn the heat up a smidge. Stir well, breaking up the pork with your spoon. Cook for a few minutes, until the pork has lost all its bright pink colour. Add the tomato purée, cumin and paprika. Stir for 2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and chocolate. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook on a low simmer, stirring occasionally. After the chilli has been cooking for 20 minutes, preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Brush the cut side of the squash halves with oil and season. Place cut side down in a baking dish and roast. After a further 25 minutes, uncover the chilli, add the sweetcorn kernels and beans. Simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven. Check the chilli for seasoning and stir in the coriander leaves. Mix the yoghurt with the lime zest and juice and a good pinch of salt. Spoon the chilli into the squash cavities, and serve with a good dollop of lime yoghurt.
