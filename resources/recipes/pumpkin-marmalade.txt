Pumpkin marmalade
Introduction:
This easy, four-ingredient marmalade can eaten on toast in place of the usual orange marmalade. It also makes a good filling for a simple flan. You can use pumpkin or any type of squash for this. Try adding in minced fresh ginger, which is a lovely contrast to the sweetness of the marmalade. Makes about 1.75kg. 
Ingredients:
1kg pumpkin or squash (weighed afetr removing skin and seeds) 1kg granulated sugar 2 oranges 250ml water
Method:
Cut the pumpkin or squash into small cubes. Mix with the sugar in a large bowl. Slice the oranges thinly and cut the sliced roughly into quarters. Put in a separate bowl and cover with the water. Leave both bowls to stand for 24 hours, stirring the pumpkin occasionally. Put the oranges and water in a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the pumpkin and sugar and bring gently to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil until the mixture is thick and syrupy - about 30 minutes. Pour into sterilized jars and seal.
