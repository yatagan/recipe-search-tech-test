stuffed artichokes
Introduction:
Artichokes can be simply boiled and eaten whole, picking off the leaves as you go to dunk into vinaigrette or lemon juice and melted butter. Stuffing them adds a little something extra again. 
Ingredients:
4 large globe artichokes 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped (optional) ½ garlic clove, finely chopped ½ tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled ½ tbsp capers, roughly chopped 1 tbsp chopped parsley ¼ tbsp chopped tarragon 30g Parmesan, grated, or vegetarian alternative (if not using anchovies either) olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
First, prepare your artichokes. Cut off the artichoke stalk. Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the juice of a lemon or a few tablespoons of white wine vinegar. Lower the artichokes upright into the pan and simmer for approx. 30-45 minutes. When they're ready, a leaf should come off easily and the fleshy base will feel tender when bitten. Leave to cool, then remove the inner leaves and hairy choke in the middle with a teaspoon. Mix the anchovies (if using), garlic, vinegar and mustard together in a bowl. Roughly chop or grate the eggs. Add to the bowl with the capers, herbs and Parmesan. Give it a good mix. Add enough olive oil to loosen to a spoonable consistency. Check the seasoning. Spoon the mixture into the artichokes.
