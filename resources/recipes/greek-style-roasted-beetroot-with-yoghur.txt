Greek-style roasted beetroot, with yoghurt and pistachios
Introduction:
Sweet and earthy oven-roasted beets set off by tangy yoghurt and crunchy toasted pistachios. This vegetarian dish is best served with flatbreads and salad or as part of a mezze. 
Ingredients:
4 medium to large beetroot, washed (but don’t peel them) 3 tbsp olive oil zest & juice of ½ lemon 2 tbsp plain yoghurt, plus extra to serve 2 tbsp pistachio nuts, toasted & chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the beetroot in a baking dish, add 1cm water and cover with foil. Bake in the oven for 1-1½ hours, or until tender. Remove from the oven and leave until just cool enough to handle, then rub the skins off with your hands. Chop into wedges. Meanwhile whisk the olive oil and lemon juice together and toss with the beetroot while still warm. Season and leave to cool, then stir in the yoghurt. Place in a serving dish and sprinkle over the pistachios and lemon zest. Serve with an extra dollop of yoghurt.
