Courgette and lemon relish
Introduction:
Although it takes a little while to cook, this recipe is extremely simple to follow and very rewarding for inexperienced relish makers. The delicate flesh of courgettes takes on spices beautifully. Eat with hard cheese or cold meats – it goes especially well with chicken. 
Ingredients:
3 courgettes, halved lengthways & cut into 2 cm pieces 2 small onions, finely sliced 2 lemons, peeled, halved lengthways & thinly sliced 100ml dry white wine 1 tbsp sultanas or raisins 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tsp coriander seeds
Method:
Place all ingredients in a saucepan. Cover and cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1-1½ hours. Bottle or decant the relish into a bowl, including all remaining liquid, and cool before eating.
