Perfect borlotti beans
Introduction:
Plump, creamy and substantial the only downside is that they lose their speckled markings when cooked. Perfect as a simple side dish or mashed with green herbs to top a bruschetta. Fold them into a rich tomato sauce for some posh baked beans, drop them into stews and soups, or even substitute them for mash under your favourite bangers, served with a slick of hot mustard and wilted greens. When the season is over you can still buy them cooked and tinned from our store cupboard staples range.
Ingredients:
500g borlotti beans bay leaf 3 garlic cloves, bashed with the back of a knife small sprig rosemary, thyme or sage 1 small tomato, crushed in the hand salt
Method:
Pod the beans and place them in a pan of cold water, throw in the remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil and simmer until soft and yielding, somewhere between 25-40 minutes, skim any foam that forms on the surface. Now salt the water well, rest for 10 minutes to let the beans take on some of the seasoning. Drain, saving the cooking water, remove all the non-bean cooking debris. Dress with olive oil, plenty of lemon juice and some more salt if needed. If you want a wetter mix add a dash of the cooking liquid and mash a few of the beans with a fork.
