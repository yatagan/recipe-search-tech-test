Steamed broccoli and sherry fried breadcrumbs
Introduction:
Quick-steamed broccoli with crispy sherry-fried golden breadcrumbs. Serve with poached eggs for a light supper for brunch. Or with fish or chicken and some couscous or bulghur for a more substantial meal. 
Ingredients:
60g butter 25g breadcrumbs 2 tbsp medium dry sherry e.g. amontillado 1 head broccoli, about 175g, cut into clorets splash sherry, white wine or balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Melt half the butter in a frying pan. Add the breadcrumbs and season well. Once the butter has been absorbed, add the sherry. Turn the heat down to low and cook, stirring gently for 10-15 minutes, until the breadcrumbs have separated again and turned a golden colour. Meanwhile steam the broccoli until just tender (3-4 minutes). Put on a serving plate. Melt the rest of the butter in the pan until it turns a golden brown colour. Remove from the heat and carefully add the vinegar (it will spit a bit). Sprinkle the breadcrumbs over the broccoli, pour over the butter.
