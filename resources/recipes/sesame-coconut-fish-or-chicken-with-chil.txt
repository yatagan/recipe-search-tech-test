Sesame coconut fish (or chicken) with chilli spinach
Introduction:
This is a grown up, healthy and more exciting version of fish fingers. Sesame gives the crust a lovely crunch and desiccated coconut augments rather than hides the taste of the fish. A delicious, light meal in its own right, serve this with spinach gomae, and rice or new potatoes if you want some more bulk. 
Ingredients:
for the fisht: 1 tsp brown sugar 2 tsp oyster sauce 1 egg, lightly beaten 2 tbsp sesame seeds 2 tbsp desiccated coconut 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 4x175g pieces of white fish fillet, skinned (or 4 chicken breasts, skinned) 2 tbsp sunflower oil for the spinach: 1 tbsp sunflower oil 1-2 red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2.5cm fresh ginger, finely grated 300g spinach, stalks removed salt & pepper
Method:
For the fish: Mix all the crust ingredients together and spread them over the fish fillets. Chill for a few hours to firm up. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Heat 2 tablespoons of the sunflower oil in a large, ovenproof frying pan. Place the fish in the hot oil, crust-side down, and cook over a medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. Carefully turn the fish over with a spatula, transfer the pan to an oven and bake for 4–5 minutes (10 minutes for chicken), until cooked through. Make the spinach. Heat the remaining sunflower oil in a frying pan, add the chilli and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Turn up the heat, add the spinach and cook, stirring vigorously, until wilted. Season to taste. Serve the fish on the spinach.
