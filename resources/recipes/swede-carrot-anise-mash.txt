Swede, carrot and anise mash
Introduction:
This mash requires a cautious but pronounced hit of star anise (trust me it works). Too much and the balance is lost, you’ll taste nothing but liquorice. This would work wonders raked on top of a cottage or shepherd’s pie in place of the usual mashed potato. You can boil the roots before mashing but using this method counters their tenancy towards wateriness in the final mash. 
Ingredients:
½ swede, peeled & 2cm dice 2 large carrots, peeled & 2cm dice 1 tbsp cider vinegar butter 1 star anise, finely ground maple syrup or runny honey
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil a pan. Add the carrots and swede, fry them vigorously for 2 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper as you do so. Add the vinegar, a knob of butter and 100ml of water. Let it come up to a furious bubble and then clamp on a tight lid. Cook over a medium/high heat for 20 minutes. Stir and check every so often, adding more water if drying out. When the roots are tender, remove the lid and evaporate any remaining liquid away until glossy. Now blend in a food processor or mash well with plenty of butter. Add a little maple syrup, a scant pinch or two of ground anise and salt & pepper until balanced to your tastes. It will never be silken, so lightly lumpy is all part of the charm.
