green beans with pancetta & sage
Introduction:
Serve as a side dish to chicken or toss through pasta to make it a main meal in its own right, sprinkled with a little grated Parmesan. Add a pinch of chilli flakes if you like heat. You could also use a little very finely chopped rosemary instead of sage. 
Ingredients:
500g French beans, topped & tailed sunflower or light olive oil, for frying 250g pancetta, or bacon, cut into small cubes 8–10 sage leaves (depending on size), finely shredded splash of balsamic or sherry vinegar olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the beans in a pan of salted water for 3 minutes. Drain, refresh in a bowl of ice cold water, then drain again once cooled. In a pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat. Add the pancetta and fry on a high heat, turning now and then, for about 5 minutes, until crispy. Turn the heat a little lower and cook for a further 5 minutes to render any fat in the pancetta. Add the beans and sage and stir for 2–3 minutes, to finish cooking the beans. Add a splash of vinegar, a little good olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve drizzled with any juices from the pan.
