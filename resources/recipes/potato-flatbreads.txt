Potato flatbreads
Introduction:
Traditionally made with leftover potato, this recipe can be either grilled or baked, with or without a topping. Adding potato keeps the crumb soft after cooking. They're lovely with soup or salad for a light lunch, but also work well with sweet accompaniments: try butter, cinnamon and sugar, or peanut butter and jam. This quantity makes 4 large flatbreads or 8 individual ones. 
Ingredients:
150g potatoes, peeled & diced 500g unbleached strong flour 1 tsp salt 2 tsp instant dried yeast 250ml warm water olive oil sea salt (optional) freshly chopped rosemary
Method:
Boil potatoes until tender, then purée using a potato ricer or food mill. Mix flour, salt and potato with your fingers. Dissolve yeast in a little of the water, then mix with the remaining water and 1 tablespoon oil. Make a well in the flour mixture, then tip in yeast mixture and stir in some of the flour. Transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until smooth and elastic. Put dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a tea towel & leave in a draught-free place to double in size for 1½ hours. After, divide into 4 or 8 pieces and roll into balls. Place a heavy baking tray into the oven and preheat to 220ºC/Gas 7. Lightly knock back each ball of dough on a floured work surface, then stretch the dough by hand or roll out using a rolling pin. If you like, brush with oil and scatter with sea salt & rosemary. Slap dough on to tray and bake for 5-8 minutes until the surface has bubbled and the edges are crisp.
