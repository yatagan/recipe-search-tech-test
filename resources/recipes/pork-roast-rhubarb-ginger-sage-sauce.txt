Pork roast with rhubarb, ginger and sage sauce
Introduction:
The sharp-sweet taste of rhubarb makes a good change from traditional apple sauce for eating with roast pork. You can either leave it as is or whizz it up into a smooth purée. This recipe also works fine with a 500g joint – just halve all the quantities and the pork's cooking time. 
Ingredients:
1kg lean boneless pork joint olive oil 400g rhubarb, washed, leaf & base cut off 20g butter 2 shallots, finely chopped 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 10 sage leaves, chopped honey to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Take the joint out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Brush the pork with olive oil, and rub in some salt and pepper. Roast for 1 hour 45 minutes before resting for 10-15 minutes. Always test pork by inserting a skewer into the thickest part of the joint; the juices must run clear, not pink. Make the sauce by trimming the rhubarb, stripping away any stringiness. Cut into 2 cm lengths and stew gently in the butter in a stainless steel pan with the chopped shallot, grated ginger, torn sage and some salt and pepper until tender. Increase the heat to evaporate some of the liquid and add a little honey to taste. Serve warm, beside thick slices of the roasted pork.
