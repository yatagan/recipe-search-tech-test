Sausage, kale and sun-dried tomato pasta
Introduction:
This is a super-easy, rustic pasta dish that only calls for about 5 ingredients. If you can use spelt penne rather than white â€“ it's extra flavour sits well with the punch of sun-dried tomatoes and robust kale. If you have spinach or chard in your box, just use that in place of kale - reduce the cooking time accordingly. 
Ingredients:
400g penne pasta 2 tbsp olive oil 450g pork sausages, sliced open, sausage meat removed & roughly crumbled, casings discarded 250g kale, tough stalks removed & discarded, leaves roughly chopped 12 sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped 4 tbsp Parmesan, freshly grated olive oil, for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan of salted boiling water, cook the penne according to the packet instructions. Drain and reserve the cooking water. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the sausage meat and cook on a low to medium heat for about 6 or 7 minutes, until just cooked through. Add the kale and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for a minute, stirring constantly, then add a couple of ladles of the pasta cooking water. Simmer for another couple of minutes or so, until the kale has wilted and the liquid reduced. Add the Parmesan and season. Stir to combine and serve with a drizzle of olive oil or some of the sun-dried tomato oil.
