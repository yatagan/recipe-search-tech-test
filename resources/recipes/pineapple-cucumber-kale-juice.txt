Pineapple, cucumber & kale juice
Introduction:
The totally tropical taste meets winter greens, doesn’t sound like it should work but it does. This should yield about 3-400ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge.
Ingredients:
100g kale ¼ pineapple skinned ½ cucumber
Method:
Juice it. Drink it.
