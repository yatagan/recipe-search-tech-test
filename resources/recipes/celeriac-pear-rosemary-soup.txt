Celeriac, pear and rosemary soup
Introduction:
The only difficult thing about this smooth, nutty-sweet winter soup is peeling the knobbly celeriac. It's good for vegans because the blended veg give a lovely creaminess without resorting to dairy. If you're a soup purist, sieve the soup after blending to remove any little bits of rosemary. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 1 medium celeriac, peeled & diced 2 small pears, peeled, cored & deseeded 1 sprig of fresh rosemary, leaves only 1.2 litres veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan, then add the onion and fry gently for 8-10 minutes, until soft. Add the celeriac, pears, rosemary and stock, and season. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the veg is soft. Use a food processor or blender to blitz to a pur√©e, and reheat to serve.
