Chorizo stew
Introduction:
This stew recipe is a very rough guide; adjust the quantities of potatoes, beans and chorizo as you like, and you can also add some fresh or tinned tomatoes with the stock. It's very good with a dollop of sour cream or crème fraîche on the side, and some crusty bread to mop up the sauce. It would also work nicely with squash or sweet potato instead of potato. 
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, sliced slug of olive oil 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped 300g spicy sausage, e.g. cooking chorizo, cut into thick slices 2 tsp paprika (smoked if possible) 1 bay leaf 250ml stock 250g runner beans, sliced 500g potatoes, peeled & diced glass of sherry or red wine (optional) handful fresh parsley or coriander, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onion in the olive oil until soft. Add the chopped garlic and sausage, stir briefly and cook until the fat begins to run. Add the paprika and bay leaf, stir, and then add the stock. Bring to the boil and add the beans and potatoes. Cook for 10-15 minutes. Add the sherry or wine if using, and bubble for a minute or two. Check the seasoning, adding more paprika or garlic if you like. Finally stir through the herbs and serve.
