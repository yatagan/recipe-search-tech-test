Purple sprouting broccoli with anchovy and chilli
Introduction:
This classic combination makes an excellent accompaniment to grilled fish or lamb, or can be turned easily into a mid-week supper by mixing with pasta or spelt. If anchovies aren't your thing, try capers instead. Outside the short purple sprouting broccoli season, the dressing is equally delicious with other robust green veg like kale or chard. 
Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced Â½ red chilli, chopped 5-6 anchovy fillets 500g purple sprouting broccoli, blanched
Method:
Cook the garlic and chilli in olive oil for 1 minute, then add the anchovy fillets. Remove from the heat and mash with a wooden spoon until the anchovies have almost completely disintegrated. Add the blanched purple sprouting broccoli, mix well and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season & serve.
