French beans, lentils and sun-dried tomatoes
Introduction:
Earthy lentils tossed with quick-blanched French beans and piquant sundried tomatoes. This is a wholesome, nutritious one-bowl meal that's good topped with a handful of rocket and a crumbling of feta. Alternatively, it makes an excellent pairing with roast lamb or grilled lamb chops. You could use roasted cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried tomatoes, or make this with runner or green beans instead of French. 
Ingredients:
100g dried Puy lentils 2-3 garlic cloves, crushed 125ml white wine 200g French beans, topped & tailed 8 sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 1 tsp Dijon mustard 1 tsp balsamic vinegar small handful parsley leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Rinse the lentils in a sieve under cold water. Drain and put in a medium pan. Add the garlic, wine and 450ml water. Bring up to a low boil and cook for 25 minutes until the lentils are tender. Keep an eye on the liquid and top up with a little more water if needed. By the end of cooking you want the lentils to be soft and the liquid almost all absorbed. Meanwhile, boil the beans in another pan of salted water for 5 minutes. Drain, refresh in a bowl of iced or cold water. Drain again once cooled. Once the lentils are tender, stir in the sundried tomatoes, mustard, vinegar, parsley and beans. Season.
