Spiced cauliflower soup with yoghurt and dates
Introduction:
This unusual vegetarian soup really draws out the taste of cauliflower with a wonderful combination of warm, Indian-style spices, sweet dates and tangy yoghurt. It's substantial enough for a light lunch on its own, or eat with warm naan or pitta bread. If you'd like a vegan version, just omit the yoghurt. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 cauliflower, cut into florets (use the inner green leaves too), roughly chopped 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground coriander ½ tsp paprika little nutmeg, freshly grated 1 litre veg stock a little natural yoghurt 6-8 dates, pitted & chopped fresh coriander, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and gently fry for 7-8 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the cauliflower and spices and cook, stirring continuously, for another couple of minutes. Add the stock, season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the cauliflower is soft. Blitz until smooth. Serve with a swirl of yoghurt, topped with chopped dates and coriander if you have it.
