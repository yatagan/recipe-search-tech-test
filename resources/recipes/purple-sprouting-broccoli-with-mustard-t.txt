Purple sprouting broccoli with mustard and tarragon hollandaise
Introduction:
Picked from February to April, these lovely green spears go just as well as asparagus with hollandaise sauce. Try this with poached eggs for a new twist on brunch, or have it for a quick, healthy dinner with a fillet of grilled salmon. 
Ingredients:
250g unsalted butter 3 egg yolks juice of 1 lemon pinch cayenne pepper 2 tsp wholegrain mustard 1 tsp fresh tarragon, chopped 1 tsp fresh chives, chopped 400g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed salt & pepper
Method:
To make the sauce, melt the butter slowly in a pan, then remove from the heat. Put the egg yolks, lemon juice and cayenne in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, making sure the water doesnâ€™t touch the base of the bowl. Using a balloon whisk, whisk until slightly thickened, then whisk in the melted butter a little at a time until it has all been incorporated. The sauce should be thick and glossy. Stir in the mustard and herbs and season with salt and pepper. The sauce will keep in a warm place for about an hour. Cook the purple sprouting broccoli in a large pan of boiling salted water until just tender. Drain and refresh in cold water, then dry well and season. Heat a ridged grill pan (or a barbecue) until very hot, then place the broccoli on it. Cook, turning occasionally, until slightly charred. Arrange on a serving dish and drizzle over the hollandaise sauce.
