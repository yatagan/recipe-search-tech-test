Rhubarb, orange and oat pudding
Introduction:
Sweet orange pairs nicely with tangy rhubarb in this creamy dessert. You could also tone down the sugar slightly and eat it for breakfast. 
Ingredients:
400g rhubarb, cut into pieces 8 tbsp soft brown sugar (you could use a mixture of dark & light muscavado) zest & juice of 1 orange 100g oats 7 tbsp thick cream
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Mix the rhubarb with 6 tablespoons of the sugar, orange zest and half the juice. Put the mixture into a medium sized dish. Mix the oats with the rest of the sugar and the cream, and drop it in spoonfuls over the rhubarb. Bake for 30 minutes until the top is brown.
