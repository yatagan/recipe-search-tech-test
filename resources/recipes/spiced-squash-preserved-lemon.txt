Spiced squash and preserved lemon
Introduction:
Sweet, tender squash, beautifully spiced and offset by fine slices of tangy preserved lemon. This vegetarian dish is tasty enough to be a light dinner with just a bowl of couscous, or makes a good accompaniment to North African-spiced meats such as lamb or chicken tagine. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, red or white, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground cumin Â½ tsp ground ginger 1 small butternut squash (about 1kg), peeled & seeds removed, cut into chunks rind of 1 preserved lemon, finely sliced 1 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp water handful fresh parsley, coriander, or a bit of both, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the onion. Fry for a few minutes until tender. Add the garlic and fry for a couple more minutes. Add the spices and fry for another minute. Add the squash, preserved lemon, lemon juice and water and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the squash is just tender. Add a little more water if it looks like it's drying out too much. Season to taste and toss with the herbs to serve.
