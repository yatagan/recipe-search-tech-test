Sweetcorn Hash with Soft-boiled Egg
Introduction:
Corn stripped straight from the cob is a world away from the tinned variety. A serrated knife is best for the job; use a slight sawing action and cut close to the cob to remove the kernels. Here we've paired it with salad potatoes, peppers, spinach and eggs for a classic hash. 
Ingredients:
400g salad potatoes, chopped into 2-3 cm chunks 1 Romano pepper, deseeded & diced 1 onion finely sliced 2 sweetcorn cobs, husks removed, kernels cut off 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 15g coriander, chopped, stalks & all 2 eggs 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 tsp smoked paprika ½ tbsp light brown sugar 1 tbsp cider vinegar 200g spinach ¼ tsp chilli flakes - add to taste 1 lime
Method:
Boil the potatoes in salted water for 6 mins. Drain when done. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan. Fry the potatoes, pepper and onion on a low-medium heat for 8 mins, stirring often. Fill the same saucepan with boiled water. Bring to a gentle simmer. Gently lower in the eggs. Cook for 7 mins, or 8-9 mins if you prefer a firmer yolk, while you continue. Into the frying pan, stir the sweetcorn, garlic, tomato purée, paprika, sugar and vinegar. Cook for 5 mins. Add a splash of water if it looks a bit dry. Transfer the egg pan to the sink. Keeping the eggs in the pan, tip out most of the water, then run the pan under the cold tap to cool the eggs enough to handle. Carefully peel the eggs. Handful by handful, stir the spinach into the potato pan, until wilted. Stir in ½ the coriander. Season to taste. Serve the potato hash. Halve the eggs and place on top. Garnish with remaining coriander and a few chilli flakes. Serve with wedges of lime.
