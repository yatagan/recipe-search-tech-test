Smashed kohlrabi, apple and cider
Introduction:
Kohl rabi will never mash into a smooth purée, so embrace this fact by giving in to a bit of texture and unevenness. Call it rustic if you like. This is a gentle, sweet-sharp side dish full of fibre and vitamin C, and it goes well with pretty much anything. 
Ingredients:
1 apple, peeled & chopped into small dice 1 kohlrabi, peeled & chopped into small dice 125ml cider ½ tsp cider vinegar 25g butter pinch allspice 1 tbsp honey 1 tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Put the apple, kohlrabi, cider, vinegar, butter and allspice in a pan, with just enough water to cover. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for about 25 minutes, until the liquid has evaporated and everything is tender (top up with a little more water if it dries out). Turn up the heat to reduce it if you need to. Add the honey and mustard and lightly smash with a fork or masher. Season to taste.
