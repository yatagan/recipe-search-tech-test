Provençal baked mackerel
Introduction:
The Mediterranean diet is supposedly one of the healthiest in the world. Luckily, it’s also one of the tastiest! This colourful representation is a real treat - try with a glass of rosé for that South of France holiday feeling.
Ingredients:
1 tbsp capers 2 mackerel oil for roasting 1 courgette 1 romano pepper 2 garlic cloves 1 rosemary stalk 250g cherry tomatoes 60g black olives 1 tsp dried oregano 100ml white wine 1 lemon salt & pepper 150g white basmati rice 1 pinch saffron 15g parsley
Method:
Put the capers in a mug of cold water. Leave to soak. Preheat your oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Rinse the mackerel, particularly inside the cavities, then pat dry with kitchen paper. Brush a large roasting tin (a non-stick one is ideal) with oil. Cut 3 shallow slashes down one side of each mackerel (approx. 1cm deep). Lay them slash-side up in the tin. Slice the courgette into 2-3cm chunks. Deseed and slice the pepper into similar sized pieces. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Finely chop ½ tbsp worth of rosemary leaves. Spread the courgette, pepper, tomatoes, garlic and olives around each mackerel. Drain and scatter over the capers. Scatter over the rosemary and oregano. Pour over the wine and drizzle with a little oil. Squeeze a little lemon juice (approx. 1 tsp) over each mackerel. Season. Bake for 20-25 mins., until the mackerel is cooked through (it will feel firm to the touch). Meanwhile, boil a kettle. Rinse the rice in a sieve. Transfer to a saucepan. Add the saffron and a pinch of salt. Cover with 500ml boiled water. Cook on a low boil for 10 mins, then remove from the heat, cover with a lid or plate and leave the rice to steam for a further 10 mins. Roughly chop the parsley leaves. Check the rice is tender (drain off any excess liquid) and the mackerel is cooked through. Serve the mackerel and veg with the rice, sprinkled with parsley.
