Lanttulaatikko (Finnish swede casserole)
Introduction:
We first came across this dish as one of those culinary curios, an odd merging of savoury and sweet. Delicious served with wilted greens and ham if you're a meat eater.
Ingredients:
1 egg 150g double cream ½ tsp ground nutmeg ½ tsp ground ginger 1 tbsp molasses or black treacle 60g stale white breadcrumbs 800g swede, cooked & mashed 50g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3. Whisk the egg into the double cream with the nutmeg, ginger, molasses and half the breadcrumbs. Beat the cream mix into the mashed swede, season with salt and tip the mix into a medium sized oven dish. Melt the butter in a small pan. Add the remaining breadcrumbs and stir to evenly coat them. Scatter the buttery crumbs evenly across the swede and bake in the oven for 50-60 minutes until the top is golden.
