Thai-style marinated cucumber salad
Introduction:
This is a good way of dressing up cucumber so that it holds its own as an independent dish. It's goes well with a barbecue, particularly with fish. 
Ingredients:
1 cucumber, peeled & seeds removed with a teaspoon or knife 1 tsp salt 2 tsp sugar 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar 2 bunched onions, sliced 1 chilli, deseeded & finely chopped small handful fresh coriander
Method:
Put the cucumber in a colander over a bowl. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt. Leave for 1 hour. Drain off the liquid and pat the cucumber dry with kitchen paper. In a small saucepan, gently heat the sugar, the other ½ teaspoon of salt and the vinegar until the sugar has just dissolved. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. In a serving bowl, mix the cucumber, onions and chilli. Pour over the cooled dressing and stir to combine. Sprinkle over the coriander leaves to serve.
