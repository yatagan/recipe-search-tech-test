Chestnut, chorizo and Brussels sprout soup
Introduction:
This hearty Brussels sprout, chestnut and chorizo soup is full textured, full flavoured and easy to make. Spicy chorizo and sweet chestnuts are very good bedfellows. It's an excellent recipe for the festive season when you want something a little lighter than roast turkey. 
Ingredients:
400g Brussels sprouts, trimmed 1 onion, chopped 1 carrot, chopped 1 bay leaf 100-150g cooking chorizo, chopped 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp cayenne pepper, or to taste 1 tsp smoked paprika (if you have it) leaves from 2 sprigs rosemary, finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, in two equal piles 2 large tomatoes or ½ tin chopped tomatoes 500g cooked peeled chestnuts, vacuum-packed or fresh 1 litre chicken or vegetable stock 4 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Separate the sprouts into two equal piles. Cut one portion into halves and finely shred the other and keep separate. In a large saucepan heat 2 tablespoons of oil and fry the onion and carrots until they start to brown. Add the bay leaf and chorizo and continue frying for another few minutes. Now add the halved sprouts, the cumin, cayenne, smoked paprika, rosemary and half the garlic and stir for another minute. Next add the tomato, chestnuts and stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Use a hand blender or food processor to blitz the soup but don’t make it too smooth – some texture is good. Reheat in the pan, adding salt and pepper as needed. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. When the oil is hot, throw in the remaining garlic and the shredded sprouts and stir fry for a minute or two until the sprouts are just tender and bright green. Stir through the soup just before serving, saving a spoonful to garnish each bowl if you like.
