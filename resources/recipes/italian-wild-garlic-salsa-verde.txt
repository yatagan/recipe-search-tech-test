A wonderful accompaniment for barbecued lamb.

Method:
Place the garlic, capers, anchovies, parsley and wild garlic in a food processor and blend well (or chop finely by hand). Place the mixture in a bowl and add the vinegar or lemon juice. Drizzle in enough olive oil to give a fairly thick consistency and season well.
