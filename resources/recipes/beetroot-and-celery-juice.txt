Beetroot and celery juice
Introduction:
A nutrient rich, bright-hued juice. Beetroot has quite a strong flavour when you juice it and most people prefer it with something to dilute it. Weâ€™ve used celery, but you could try adding an orange or carrot. 
Ingredients:
2 celery sticks, trimmed 1 very large or 2 medium beetroot
Method:
Juice all of the ingredients and enjoy.
