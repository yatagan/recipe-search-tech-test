Spicy sausage couscous salad
Introduction:
This North African inspired dish is hearty and versatile. It's good with merguez sausages – red, spicy and made with beef or lamb – but any spicy sausage will do fine. Small piquanté peppers can be bought in a jar from most larger food shops and delis, but chillies are a good substitute. The carrots can be supplemented by any root veg you have in your box. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp pine nuts 500g merguez sausage, cut into 3-4cm pieces, on the diagonal 1 bunch (about 300g) carrots, scrubbed & cut into 3-4cm pieces, on the diagonal 1 red pepper, deseeded & cut into pieces 2 tbsp olive oil 300g couscous small knob of butter 2 bunched onions, peeled & thinly sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed 300ml hot stock (beef, chicken or veg) zest of 1 orange zest of 1 lemon 16 small piquanté peppers, sliced (or use 1 or 2 fresh red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped) large handful fresh parsley, chopped 100g salad leaves, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. In a small frying pan, lightly toast the pine nuts. Remove from the heat and leave to one side. Place the sausage, carrots and red pepper in a baking dish. Pour over the oil and roast in the oven at for about 30 minutes, or until the carrot is just tender. While the sausages are cooking, put the couscous in a large bowl with the butter, onion and garlic. Pour over the stock and leave for 10 minutes, fluffing with a fork every now and then. Add the cooked sausages and veg (include any cooking juices), the orange and lemon zest, piquanté peppers and parsley. Toss to combine, season to taste and serve on the salad leaves, topped with the toasted pine nuts.
