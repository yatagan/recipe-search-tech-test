Penne with broad beans, bacon, mint and cream
Introduction:
This makes a great quick pasta dish for a week night dinner, but you could also skip the penne and serve the sauce as an accompaniment to grilled or roast chicken. Double pod the beans if they're getting on the large side, but otherwise it's not necessary. 
Ingredients:
500g broad beans, shelled 400g penne 100g pancetta or smoked streaky bacon, cut into fine lardons 1 tbsp butter or olive oil 1 garlic clove, crushed 200ml double cream small bunch fresh mint, roughly chopped 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the broad beans in boiling salted water for a few minutes, until tender. Drain and set aside. Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, fry the bacon in the butter or oil until just beginning to brown, then add the garlic and stir for a minute without letting it colour. Stir in the cream, mint and broad beans and simmer for a few minutes. Then add the Parmesan and season to taste. When the pasta is done, drain well, toss with the sauce and serve immediately.
