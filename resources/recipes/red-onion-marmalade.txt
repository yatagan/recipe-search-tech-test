Red onion marmalade
Introduction:
Eat this red onion marmalade straight away or make it ahead for Christmas. This amount will give you 10-12oz – enough to fill an 8oz jar with a bit leftover to eat immediately. Just double (or triple) the quantities for a larger batch. This can also be made with white onions, but red ones look more festive! Red onion marmalade’s good on a cheese board, or with beef or venison steaks. Serve as a starter on bruschetta with goat’s cheese. For a vegetarian main course, wrap goat’s cheese with a little marmalade and some cranberry sauce in filo or puff pastry and bake. Try adding a crushed garlic clove, or some dried chilli flakes with the onions, for a slightly different flavour. 
Ingredients:
40g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 500g red onions, finely sliced 35g light brown sugar (about 4 tbsp) 70ml red wine vinegar 30ml balsamic vinegar 200ml red wine 50ml port (or use more red wine)
Method:
In a large stainless steel or enamelled cast iron pan, heat the butter and oil. Add the onions and sugar and stir well to combine. Simmer on the lowest heat for about 40-50 minutes, until the onions have turned a darker colour. Stir only occasionally, and do not allow the mixture to catch on the bottom. Add the vinegars, red wine and port, and season. Simmer for a further 30-40 minutes or so, until the liquid has pretty much evaporated; if you drag a wooden spoon through the mixture you should see the bottom of the pan and the mixture should have a syrupy consistency. While cooking this final stage, sterilise your jar (if you are planning to keep the mixture) by placing it on a baking tray and putting in a cold oven. Set the temperature to 140°C/Gas 1 and leave it there until needed. Put the mixture while it is still hot, seal it immediately with a vinegar-proof lid and turn it upside down for 5 minutes to sterilise the lid. It should keep for up to 3 months.
