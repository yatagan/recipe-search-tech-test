Ricotta and basil courgettes
Introduction:
Why wait until the courgettes have grown into marrows before stuffing them? The filling here is inspired by the type of mix that would go perfectly in stuffed and fried courgette flowers. Sad to say these ethereal treats would not survive the picking and packing process so this is the next best thing.
Ingredients:
2 large courgettes or 3 smaller zest & juice of 1 lemon 125g ricotta 30g pine nuts 50g Parmesan 30g breadcrumbs 20g basil nutmeg salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Split the courgettes in half length-ways. Season well, olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Bake them for 10 minutes. Meanwhile place the ricotta, pine nuts, Parmesan, half the lemon zest and the breadcrumbs in a bowl and mix together. Tear in the basil leaves. Remove the courgettes and using the tip of a teaspoon scrap out the softer seedy cores. Chop the flesh you have removed and mix it into the ricotta with some olive oil to loosen. Season well and grate in a little nutmeg to taste. Spoon the mix evenly back into the hollowed courgettes. Drizzle over some more olive oil and return to the oven for 15 minutes until baked and bubbling.
