Root veg and rosemary ragu
Introduction:
This is a rich-tasting, easy to make sauce which goes a long way. It can be adapted to whatever ingredients you have in the house. Using both beef and pork mince gives a nice balance of rich and light, but you could stick with one or the other, or substitute for lamb, or even turkey (cook for slightly less time if using turkey mince). The veg quantities can be adapted to your veg box contents. Toss this with pasta, use to layer a lasagne, or eat scooped over mashed potatoes. It freezes and re-heats very well. 
Ingredients:
olive oil 2 large onions, finely diced 2 sticks celery, finely diced 2 carrots, finely diced 4 streaky bacon rashers, chopped into small pieces 400g beef mince 400g pork mince 3 tbsp tomato purée 2 large sprigs rosemary, leaves very finely chopped 500 ml red wine 500 ml chicken stock 800g root veg (e.g. 1 parsnip, ½ medium swede, ½ celeriac), diced to 1-2cm salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large pan. Add the onion, celery and carrot. Fry very gently for 12-15 minutes, stirring now and then, until softened. Turn up the heat a little, add the bacon and fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the beef and pork and fry to brown. Add the tomato purée and stir for 1 minute. Add the rosemary, wine, stock and veg. Season and simmer very gently for 1½ hours, giving the odd stir now and then to stop it catching on the bottom.
