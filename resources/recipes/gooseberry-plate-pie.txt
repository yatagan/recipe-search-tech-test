Gooseberry plate pie
Introduction:
With crispy pastry and a slightly tart filling, this pie was traditionally made on an enamel plate, but a shallow pie dish will do. Enjoy with a dollop of thick Greek yoghurt on the side. 
Ingredients:
350g plain flour 120g icing sugar 250 unsalted butter, cut up 4 medium egg yolks 3 tbsp caster sugar (increase the sugar to taste) 500g gooseberries a little milk, for glazing icing sugar, for dusting
Method:
First make the pastry. Put the flour and icing sugar in a food processor and mix briefly. Add the butter and pulse until the consistency resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolks and pulse until the pastry comes together. Wrap in cling film and leave in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Divide the pastry in half and roll out one piece on a lightly floured surface. Use to line the base of a 25cm enamel plate or shallow pie dish. Mix the sugar and gooseberries in a bowl and then pile on to the pastry base. Roll out the remaining pastry and lay it on top of the pie, pressing down at the edge to seal and trimming off the excess. Crimp the edges. Make a few cuts in a shape on top of the pastry, so the steam can escape, then decorate with leaves, gooseberries etc made out of the excess pastry – go crazy! Brush the top of the pie with a little milk, then place in the oven and bake for about 40 minutes, until the gooseberries are tender and the pastry is browned. Dust with icing sugar and serve.
