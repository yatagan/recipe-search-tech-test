Cauliflower three ways 
Introduction:

Ingredients:
cauliflower
Method:
Rice: Cauliflower rice/couscous is all the rage amongst low carb dieters and the gluten free. Blitz raw cauliflower florets in a processor until it resembles the aforementioned rice. Fry lightly for a few minutes before adding hot water or stock. Cook for a matter of minutes until tender. Raw: Not to everyone’s taste but if cut into small florets or finely sliced it can make a good addition to a robust salads. Try it with the mustard dressing that follows, some crumbled blue cheese, salad leaves and toasted hazelnuts. Roast: Just as if you were roasting some spuds but faster. Break down into florets, not too small all crumbly, roll in a generous glug of oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 8-10 minutes at 200°C, they should be just cooked and starting to brown at the more tender edges. This works some bold spicing such as garam masala of smoked paprika added to the mix.
