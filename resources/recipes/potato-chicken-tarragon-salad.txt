Potato, chicken and tarragon salad
Introduction:
This hearty, aromatic chicken and potato salad is quick to put together. It's good both warm and at room temperature and makes a lovely dinner with a crisp green salad on the side. Good variations include adding radishes for crunch, capers or gherkins for piquancy, and using spring instead of normal onions. 
Ingredients:
750g salad potatoes, cleaned 1½ tbsp olive oil ½ tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp white wine vinegar ½ onion, finely sliced 2 cooked chicken breasts, cut into small pieces (or use leftover roast chicken pieces) 1 stick celery, finely sliced 1 tbsp fresh tarragon, chopped 2 tbsp mayonnaise salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water, cook the potatoes for 12-15 minutes or until tender. Drain and leave to cool slightly. In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, mustard, vinegar and seasoning. Slice the cooled potatoes and place in a large bowl. Add the onion, chicken, celery and dressing. Toss together. Mix the tarragon and mayonnaise together. Stir into the potato mixture.
