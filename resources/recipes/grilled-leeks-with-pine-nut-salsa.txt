Grilled leeks with pine nut salsa
Introduction:
It is best to use summer leeks here because you want small, mild ones; winter leeks often have a stronger flavour which along with the salsa may too powerful. This is a good accompaniment to chicken. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp lightly toasted pine nuts ½ red onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 hardboiled egg, finely chopped ½ tbsp tarragon, chopped ½ tbsp parsley, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp good wine vinegar 4 leeks salt & pepper
Method:
Mix together all the ingredients, except the leeks, for the pine nut salsa. Blanch the leeks in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain and refresh in cold water. Drain well, split in half length-ways, brush lightly with oil and sear on a hot griddle pan. Serve with the salsa.
