Warming fat-free vegetable soup
Introduction:
This a simple and virtuous soup, good for January resolutions. It relies for taste on the full flavour of our veg. Use vegetable stock to keep it vegan and vegetarian and play around as much as you like with the ingredients depending on what you have in your veg box. You can blend or not, depending on taste – if you don't, and want to make this slightly more substantial, add a small handful of quinoa to simmer for the last 15 minutes. 
Ingredients:
2 medium leeks, cleaned, trimmed & sliced (use the white & green parts) 3-4 carrots, depending on size, peeled & roughly chopped 1 medium potato, peeled & diced 1.2 litres veg or chicken stock small handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the leeks, carrots and potato in a large saucepan. Add the stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until all the veg is tender, about 20-25 minutes, depending on how small you’ve chopped it. Blitz in a processor or blender until smooth. Gently reheat in the same pan. Check the seasoning and stir in the parsley to serve.
