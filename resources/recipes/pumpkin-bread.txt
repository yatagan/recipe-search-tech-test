Pumpkin bread
Introduction:
This moist, lightly spiced bread can be treated as a savoury or cut in half and filled with cream cheese icing. You can add nuts (walnuts work especially well), substitute the nutmeg for other spices, or if you prefer simplicity, omit the raisins. 
Ingredients:
200g wholemeal flour 3 tsp baking powder 100g vegetable margarine 100g raw cane sugar 200g pumpkin, cooked 2-3 tbsp milk ½ tsp nutmeg, grated 75g raisins
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Sift the flour and baking powder. Cream the margarine and sugar together in a bowl. Mash the cooked pumpkin until smooth and add to the creamed mixture. Fold in the sifted ingredients and moisten with the milk. Stir in the nutmeg and raisins. Spoon the mixture into a greased 2lb loaf tin and bake for 35-40 minutes.
