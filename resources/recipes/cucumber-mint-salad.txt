Cucumber and mint salad
Introduction:
This is an easy, healthy and refreshing summer salad with plenty of crunch. It's good for balancing out heavier dishes such as fatty lamb chops or oily fish, and it looks beautiful too. Add a little creamy feta and eat with pitta to make this a light vegetarian lunch on its own. 
Ingredients:
250g cucumber, finely sliced Â¼ red onion,1 bunched or 1 salad onion, finely sliced 4 radishes, sliced 8-10 mint leaves, chopped 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 2 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
In a bowl combine the cucumber, onion, radish and mint. In another small bowl whisk the vinegar and oil. Add to the cucumber mix and toss together. Season to taste and crumble with cheese to serve.
