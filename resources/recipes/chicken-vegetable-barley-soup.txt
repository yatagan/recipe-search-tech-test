Chicken, vegetable and barley soup
Introduction:
Much more flavourful than breast meat, chicken leg meat works well in this tasty soup. This is a really hearty and comforting meal, and if you use our diced chicken leg, weâ€™ve already done the boning for you. Use a free hand adjusting the veg, depending on what you have in your box. This calls for good stock for the best results. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large onion, finely sliced 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 120g pearl barley 1.6 litres chicken or veg stock leaves from 2 sprigs of fresh thyme (or use a good pinch of dried) 350g diced chicken leg 3 carrots peeled & finely diced 3 celery sticks, finely diced 1-2 potatoes, depending on size, peeled & diced salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently for about 5 minutes to soften, then add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the barley, stock and thyme leaves, bring to the boil, reduce the heat, then cover and simmer for 40-45 minutes. Add the chicken, carrots, celery, potato and season to taste. Cook for 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables tender. Check the seasoning before serving.
