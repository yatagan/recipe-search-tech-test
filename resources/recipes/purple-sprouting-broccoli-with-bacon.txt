Purple sprouting broccoli braised with bacon, garlic and chilli
Introduction:
Sweetly earthy and robust, purple sprouting broccoli stands up well to the punchy flavours of garlic and chilli. Tossed with a bit of pasta, this makes a great quick midweek meal. 
Ingredients:
300g purple sprouting broccoli, cut into florets 75g smoked streaky bacon, cut into lardons 3 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1 dried chilli, chopped finely salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch the purple sprouting broccoli for 5 minutes in plenty of boiling salted water. While it is cooking fry the bacon in the olive oil until almost brown. Add the garlic and chilli and cook for another 2 minutes. Then add the purple sprouting broccoli and braise with the bacon mixture for another 5 minutes. Season this dish carefully because of the use of salty bacon and chilli.
