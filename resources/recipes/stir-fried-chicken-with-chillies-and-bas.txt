Stir-fried chicken with chillies and basil
Introduction:
This very quick chicken dish is based on a favourite Thai street food recipe. Reduce the amount of chilli if you don't like things too hot. You could substitute fish - especially squid - or beef for the chicken, or use tofu if you are vegetarian. Serve with rice. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 chicken breasts, skinned & thinly sliced 2 spring onions, sliced 2 bird’s-eye chillies (if you like it hot) or 2 mild red chillies, deseeded & sliced 1 tbsp soy sauce 1½ tbsp Thai fish sauce 1¼ tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar) leaves from a bunch basil
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok, add the chicken and stir-fry over a high heat until it turns white. Add the spring onions and chillies and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the sauces and sugar and toss briefly, then add the basil leaves.
