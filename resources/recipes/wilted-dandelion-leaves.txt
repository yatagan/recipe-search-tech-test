Wilted dandelion leaves with lemon, garlic and olive oil
Introduction:
As strange as it seems, lemon juice actually helps to temper strong bitter tastes. Bitter and sour are often confused. In this case they compete with each other to create a balance. Start cautiously and increase the lemon to fit your tastes. People experience bitter flavour in very different ways so it will be personal choice.
Ingredients:
olive oil 150g dandelion leaves, washed 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Gently warm 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan. Add the dandelions and wilt for about 2 minutes before adding the garlic. Cook for a further 2 minutes. Season well with salt, pepper and a cautious squeeze of lemon juice to taste.
