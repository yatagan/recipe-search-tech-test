Do-it-yourself lamb shawarmi
Introduction:
Strictly speaking, shawarma is a preparation of strips of seasoned meat (usually lamb) mixed with fat, formed onto a vertical spit and cooked ‘à la rotisserie’ for several hours. Yes, you’ve got it; a doner kebab. With all the trimmings, whatever you choose, a DIY kebab session is the perfect, fun, family meal. 
Ingredients:
2 onions 100ml natural yoghurt 2 tbsp herby harissa 1 tbsp ras-el-hanout 500g boneless lamb shoulder salt & pepper
Method:
Peel and quarter the onions and blitz in a food processor. Add the yoghurt, harissa and ras-el-hanout and pulse. Season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas Mark 7. De-net the lamb joint and smear the paste all over. Tie it together as best you can with a piece of string. Place on a roasting tray and roast for 20 minutes until the crust begins to brown. Remove from the oven, turn down to 140°C/Gas Mark 1 and wrap the meat in foil. Cook for another 2 hours. Cool for 30 minutes, then lift onto a chopping board. Meanwhile assemble all the trimmings: tabouleh, carrot salad, hummus, tzatziki, pita/koblenz breads, vegetable crudités and the obligatory pickled green chillies. Unwrap the lamb and carve/shred, mixing in the onion paste. Scrape it all into a bowl with a spoon or spatula. Serve the kebabs with your trimmings and dips.
