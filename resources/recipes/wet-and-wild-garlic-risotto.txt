Wet and wild garlic risotto
Introduction:
A garlic-lover's paradise! Just don't kiss anyone immediately afterwards. If you live near woods where wild garlic grows pick a handful of leaves for this recipe. If not you should find wild garlic in your veg box in March and April. No wet garlic in the fridge? The recipe will still work well without. 
Ingredients:
3 wet garlic, sliced thinly 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 small onion, finely chopped 30g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 250g risotto rice (Arborio) splash white wine or vermouth 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock (hot) large handful wild garlic leaves, roughly chopped 50g Parmesan, grated finely wild garlic flowers, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Cook garlic and onion slowly in half the butter and oil for about 10 minutes without colouring. Add rice, turn up the heat and cook until the rice is coated with garlic mix, season and add alcohol. Stir until the wine has been absorbed. Next, add the stock until rice is just covered and turn down the heat. Maintain rice at a gentle simmer and keep adding stock once the last addition has been absorbed. After about 10 minutes add wild garlic leaves and stir into rice. Add more stock. After another 5 minutes, when rice is just cooked but has some bite, add the remaining butter and cheese. Season and serve with a sprinkling of cheese and some wild garlic flowers if the fancy takes you!
