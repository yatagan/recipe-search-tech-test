Roasted Jerusalem artichokes with romesco sauce
Introduction:
Romesco sauce is a Catalan classic: a full-bodied, textured nut and red pepper-based mix. It's excellent here with tender roast Jerusalem artichokes – but would be equally good on sourdough toast, on baked eggs, with roast potatoes, lamb, grilled fish... It's highly recommended to make double quantities and keep some in the fridge. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic head 2 red peppers 75g blanched almonds, toasted until golden 25g whole hazelnuts, roasted & skinned ¼ tsp smoked paprika ½ tsp paprika 1 dried chilli, crumbled ½ tsp dried mint 1 tsp red wine vinegar, plus a little more to taste olive oil 600g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean, skins left on salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Slice the top off the garlic bulb to reveal the tips of the cloves. Drizzle with a little oil and wrap in foil. Put the peppers in a baking dish. Put both in the oven and roast for 45 minutes, turning the peppers once during cooking, until the pepper skins are blackened and the garlic soft. Put the peppers in a plastic bag and leave for a few minutes, until cool enough to handle, then peel off the skins and discard the seeds. Put the almonds, hazelnuts, peppers, both paprikas, dried chilli, mint and vinegar in a food processor with a good pinch of salt. Squeeze in about half the head of roasted garlic. Blitz, adding enough olive oil to make a thick sauce. Taste and add more vinegar, seasoning or oil. Transfer to a bowl. Cut the artichokes in half lengthways and toss in a baking dish, in just enough oil to coat. Roast until tender and golden, 30-40 minutes. Serve with the romesco dipping sauce. Season with salt and pepper.
