Thai sweetcorn fritters
Introduction:
Our cooks have made hundreds of versions of sweetcorn fritters over the years, especially at festivals. They make a great canapé, lunch box filler or brunch topped with rocket, avocado and bacon. Use tinned sweetcorn for an easy, store cupboard snack – although you lose the crunch and sweetness of fresh corn. If you've got a bit more time make you own Thai green curry paste - it makes all the difference to the taste. 
Ingredients:
3 sweetcorn cobs 100g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder 3 eggs 75ml milk 3 tbsp Thai green curry paste 15g fresh coriander leaves oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or coconut salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the sweetcorn cobs in a large pan of salted water for 10 minutes. Drain, leave to cool, then cut off the kernels. Put the flour and baking powder in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs until you have a thick, smooth batter, then gradually whisk in the milk. Stir in the Thai curry paste, sweetcorn kernels and coriander leaves. Season. Heat a layer of oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add spoonfuls of the batter. Fry in batches for 3-4 minutes on a medium high heat, until golden, then flip them over and cook the other side until golden. Drain on kitchen paper before serving.
