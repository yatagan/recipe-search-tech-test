Sugar snap peas with marjoram and lemon
Introduction:
Our sugar snap peas are at their height during July. Eat them as fresh as possible, either raw or, as here, cooked very briefly. Fragrant marjoram and zesty lemon make a lovely setting for their delicate taste. 
Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil 250g sugar snap peas 1 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp lemon zest 2 tsp fresh marjoram, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a heavy based frying pan heat the olive oil. Add the sugar snap peas and cook on a medium heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the lemon juice, zest and marjoram and toss to coat the peas. Season to taste.
