Purple sprouting broccoli and shiitake stir-fry
Introduction:
A very quick, punchy vegetarian stir-fry – good for a midweek dinner. If you can’t find tart-sweet tamarind, just leave it out. We used shiitake mushrooms, which you can add to your veg box order, but this would work well with a punnet of closed cup or Portobello mushrooms. To clean your mushrooms, wipe with a damp piece of kitchen paper or clean cloth, rather then washing them under the tap, which can make them slimy. 
Ingredients:
300g noodles (buckwheat are gluten-free) sesame oil 3 tbsp oil for frying on a high heat e.g. groundnut or sunflower 400g purple sprouting broccoli, cut into similar sized pieces (not too large) 150g shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped 5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely sliced 1-2 chillies, deseeded & finely sliced, depending on your preference for heat 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced or chopped 2 tsp tamarind paste, mixed with 2 tbsp hot water 2 tbsp soy sauce 250g marinated tofu, cut into cubes juice of 2 limes handful fresh coriander leaves handful toasted cashew nuts or peanuts, roughly chopped
Method:
Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain and toss in just enough sesame oil to coat. Leave to one side. Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. Add the purple sprouting broccoli and stir fry on a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, ginger, chilli and garlic. Fry for 1 minute. Add the tamarind, soy sauce and a couple of tablespoons of water. Stir for 1 minute. Add the tofu, lime juice, coriander and cooked noodles and stir together. Sprinkle over the nuts to serve.
