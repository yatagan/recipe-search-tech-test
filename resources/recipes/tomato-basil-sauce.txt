Tomato and basil sauce
Introduction:
This is an easy way to whip up dinner in under 30 minutes. The tastier your fresh tomatoes, the better the sauce will be. You can vary the basic recipe by adding other ingredients: black olives, anchovies, mozzarella, capers or chopped parsley, to name a few. As well as pasta, this would be good with meatballs or chicken. 
Ingredients:
6 spring onions, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 450g tomatoes, peeled & chopped 55g fresh basil 30g tomato purée ½ tsp sugar 60ml medium dry sherry or wine
Method:
Heat the oil add the onions, garlic and cook for 5 minutes Add the tomatoes to the pan, mix well, stir in the basil, tomato purée, sugar, sherry/wine, salt and pepper and mix well. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring once in a while. Serve with a pasta of your choice.
