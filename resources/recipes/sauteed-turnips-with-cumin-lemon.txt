Sautéed turnips with cumin and lemon
Introduction:
This quick and easy vegetarian side recipes brings out turnip's mild, nutty taste with a gentle, clean dressing of lemon, cumin, olive oil and fresh coriander. It goes well with basmati rice and Indian dishes, or with grilled white fish. 
Ingredients:
450g turnips 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed zest of ½ lemon, finely grated good squeeze lemon juice, to taste 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
Method:
If the turnips are on the large side, peel and cut into 2cm cubes. If they are small, trim and quarter them. Drop into a pan of lightly salted boiling water. Simmer for 5 minutes until just tender (don’t overcook them). Drain and refresh under the cold tap. Drain thoroughly and pat dry on kitchen paper. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan, add the turnips and fry until nicely browned. Stir in the cumin and lemon zest and juice, plenty of pepper and a little salt. Turn out into a serving dish and scatter with the coriander to serve.
