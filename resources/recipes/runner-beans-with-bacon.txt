Runner beans with bacon
Introduction:
The classic combination of salty, smoky bacon and runner beans makes a quick, easy and flavour-packed side which goes well with lamb or pork chops, or with grilled fish fillets. The same pairing works beautifully with broad, French or green breans. 
Ingredients:
400g runner beans 1 onion, chopped 4 slices smoked streaky bacon oil for cooking, e.g. vegetable or sunflower
Method:
Slice runner beans and boil for 3-4 minutes until just tender. Drain, refresh in cold water, drain again. Gently cook the onion in a little oil until soft. Remove from the pan, add more oil if needed and fry the bacon until crispy. Add the onion and beans to the pan and warm through.
