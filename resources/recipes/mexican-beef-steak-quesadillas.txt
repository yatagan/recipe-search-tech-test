Mexican beef steak quesadillas
Introduction:
For sandwiches, stir-fries and soups, frying steak is great. Marinade it first and it’s even better. All the work can be done in advance so all you have to do is reheat them to melt the cheese, cut them into wedges and serve them with whatever vaguely Mexican accompaniments you can muster. 
Ingredients:
400g beef frying steaks 2 tbsp fresh lime juice (about 2 limes) 1 small tin sweetcorn 1 jalapeño pepper, deseeded & minced ½ tsp hot sauce 4 large flour tortillas 250g strong Cheddar cheese for the salsa: 4 large firm tomatoes, skinned & deseeded ½ medium red onion, finely chopped 2 heaped tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 1 fresh green chilli, chopped 1 lime, juiced
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Make your salsa by simply combining all of the ingredients, adding the green chilli a bit at a time and adjusting the heat to your preference. Rub the steaks all over with salt and pepper. Pan-fry over a medium to high heat for 1-2 minutes per side or until just cooked through. Drizzle with lime juice and set aside. Combine the sweetcorn, salsa, jalapeño and hot sauce. Spread the mixture evenly over one half of each of the 4 tortillas. Cut the steaks into thin strips and lay over the sauce and sprinkle over the grated cheese. Fold over each tortilla to form a half-moon. Place on a baking tray and bake for about 10 minutes or until the cheese melts, turning halfway through cooking. Alternatively grill or griddle. Serve with the usual suspects: soured cream, guacamole, more salsa etc.
