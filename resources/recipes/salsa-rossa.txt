Salsa rossa
Introduction:
This very easy to make, piquant tomato sauce goes well with grilled meat and sausages, pasta and polenta, and steamed, roasted or battered veg. Our Travelling Field Kitchen served it on grilled lamb marinated in lemon, garlic and lots of rosemary. For vegetarians, try making Jerusalem artichokes in batter with salsa rossa.
