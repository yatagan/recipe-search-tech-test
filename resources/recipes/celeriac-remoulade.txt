Celeriac remoulade
Introduction:
At once creamy and slightly acidic, this makes a great winter salad. It's traditionally eaten either with thin slices of ham or in a salad trio with grated carrots and radishes dipped in butter and salt. Blanching the celeriac isn't essential, but it improves the flavour and texture. 
Ingredients:
1 medium celeriac juice of 1 lemon 3 tbsp Dijon mustard 150ml mayonnaise 1 tbsp double cream 1 tbsp chopped, parsley salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the celeriac and cut it into matchsticks about 3mm thick, either by hand or using a mandolin. Add them to a large pan of boiling water and cook for 1 minute, then drain well and leave to cool. Mix the remaining ingredients together and toss through the cooled celeriac. Season well. Serve the remoulade with sliced griddled sourdough bread, brushed with olive oil and a watercress salad.
