Curried courgettes
Introduction:
This healthy side dish goes well with couscous and with grilled meat or fish. Although courgettes may hold their appearance at the bottom of the fridge, their flavour deteriorates fairly quickly so it's best not to leave them too long. 
Ingredients:
400g courgettes 75g flaked almonds 1 tsp curry powder 2 tbsp olive oil handful mint, chopped
Method:
Cut the courgettes in half lengthways, then slice diagonally into 5mm-1cm thick chunks. Add the courgettes, almonds, curry powder and a pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl. Mix thoroughly. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the courgette mixture and cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes, (stirring continuously), until tender. Transfer the curried courgettes to another dish and sprinkle with the chopped mint.
