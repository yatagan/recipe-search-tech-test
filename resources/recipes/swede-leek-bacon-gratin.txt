Swede, leek & bacon gratin
Introduction:
A delicious and indulgent way to enjoy the glorious swede, the leeks could easily be replaced with boiled greens such as cabbage or kale. Leave out the bacon and it makes a flavoursome vegetarian main course.
Ingredients:
100ml milk 500ml double cream 2 garlic cloves 1 large rosemary or thyme sprig 150g smoked streaky bacon, cut into lardons 1–2 tbsp olive oil 3 leeks, white and pale green parts cut in rings knob of butter (about 30g), plus extra to grease the gratin dish 1 swede, peeled and sliced paper thin (use a mandolin if you have one) salt and black pepper
Method:
Heat the oven to 170°C/Gas 3. Put the milk, cream, garlic and rosemary or thyme in a pan over a low–medium heat. Slowly bring to a boil and then gently simmer for 5 minutes, being careful not to let it boil over. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the heat. Fry the bacon in the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat until really crispy. Add the leeks and a knob of butter and cook on a low heat for 20–30 minutes, until the leeks are soft and just beginning to caramelise. Season well with salt and pepper. Arrange half the sliced swede on the bottom of a greased gratin or shallow ovenproof dish and season. Add the sautéed leeks and then top with the remaining swede and season again. Press the layers down with the back of a spoon. Using a sieve, strain over the infused milk and cream mixture and cover the dish with foil. Bake in the oven for about 1 hour, until a blunt knife can be easily inserted through to the bottom. Uncover and bake for 15 minutes until the gratin is golden around the edges. Leave to stand for 10 minutes before serving.
