Creole potatoes
Introduction:
This is recipe has a fairly long list of ingredients but makes a fabulous vegetarian main course. Creole cuisine originates from African, Caribbean and European settlers in Louisiana and encompasses an astonishingly diverse range of flavours and techniques. 
Ingredients:
1 generous pinch saffron threads 1kg red-skinned potatoes, e.g. Desirée 4 spring onions, cut into 5cm pieces & shredded 2 tbsp sunflower oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tsp dried thyme ½ tsp cumin seeds 225g tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & chopped 1 bay leaf 150g mature Cheddar, grated 85ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Pour a few tablespoon of boiling water over the saffron threads and leave for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Place the potatoes in a saucepan with the spring onions, salt and enough water to just cover. Add the saffron and its water to the saucepan together with some salt. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender. Drain and arrange on a serving dish. Keep warm if necessary. While the potatoes are cooking make the sauce. Heat the oil in a frying-pan and fry the onion until lightly browned. Add the garlic, thyme and cumin seeds and fry for 1 minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Cook over a vigorous heat until the tomatoes have broken down to form a thick sauce. Add the cheese and cream and stir until the cheese has melted smoothly into the sauce. Pour over the potatoes and serve immediately.
