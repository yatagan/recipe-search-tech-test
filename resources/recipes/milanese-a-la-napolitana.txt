Milanese a la Napolitana
Introduction:
Despite its Italian name, this magnificent recipe is close to being Argentina’s national dish: it’s a flattened, breaded beef escalope topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella and ham and then browned under the grill until golden and bubbling. 
Ingredients:
100g fresh breadcrumbs 50g Parmesan, grated 4 beef frying steaks, beaten out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 4 mm 3 eggs, beaten 100ml olive oil 8 tbsp tomato sauce - try frying 500g tomatoes with some olive oil, crushed garlic & salt with a cup of water 4 slices cooked ham 8 tbsp mozzarella or mild Cheddar, grated
Method:
Mix the breadcrumbs and Parmesan and place in a shallow dish. Crumb the steaks by first dipping in the beaten egg and then in the breadcrumbs, so that each side is evenly coated. Fry in the olive oil for a few minutes, turning over when brown. Remove and dry with kitchen paper. Top each steak with a slice of ham, tomato sauce and grated cheese and grill until the cheese has melted. Best served with chips or potato wedges and a green salad.
