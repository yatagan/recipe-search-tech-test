Smoked haddock and parsnip fishcakes
Introduction:
These fishcakes can be baked in the oven as well as fried. They stand up well to being made in advance and frozen or kept in the fridge until you want them. Good with tartare sauce, mayonnaise, or just a squeeze of lemon. Griddled leeks and a peppery watercress salad make lovely accompaniments. 
Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped 75g streaky bacon or pancetta, finely chopped 300g smoked haddock 275ml milk 1 bay leaf 6 cloves 150g parsnips, chopped 150 potatoes, chopped 1 tsp butter handful fresh parsley, chopped pinch dried chilli, optional seasoned flour 1 egg, beaten 80 white breadcrumbs oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Sweat the onion with the bacon for 10 minutes and set aside. Poach the haddock in the milk, bay leaf and cloves in a pan. Allow to boil briefly, then turn off heat and allow fish to cool in liquid. Boil the parsnips and potatoes together until tender. Mash with the butter and a little of the fish poaching milk. Season well. Combine the onions, bacon, potatoes and parsnips, parsley and chilli if using. Flake the fish and fold into vegetable mixture. Adjust seasoning. Shape into cakes. Dip these into the seasoned flour, then beaten egg, then breadcrumbs to coat. Shallow fry until golden.
