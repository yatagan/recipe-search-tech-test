Thyme and polenta breaded beef escalopes 
Introduction:
Escalopes are a quick and simple dinner to make. This version uses beef escalopes wrapped in a thyme and polenta crust, flash-fried for a speedy dinner. Use polenta with a rice or gluten-free flour to coat for a gluten-free option, but semi-dried breadcrumbs work just as well. Serve with seasonal veg and mashed potato or a vegetable risotto made with odds and ends from your veg box. 
Ingredients:
1 large egg, 2 if small 4 tbsp plain or rice flour 100g polenta 50g parmesan, grated 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, or 2 tsp dried 4 beef escalopes oil for frying e.g. sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Put the flour onto a plate and mix with a little salt and pepper. Crack the egg(s) into a shallow bowl and beat white and yolk together. In a separate shallow bowl, mix the polenta, parmesan and thyme leaves. Coat the escalopes first in the flour, then the egg, then the polenta mixture to coat them. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large frying pan. Add the coated escalopes and fry them on a medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly golden and crisp.
