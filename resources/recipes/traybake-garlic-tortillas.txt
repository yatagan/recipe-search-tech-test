Mediterranean traybake with garlic tortillas
Introduction:
Roasting vegetables really brings out their flavour, especially with the added garlic and rosemary. Garlic tortillas to dip into the rich tomato sauce complete this vibrant vegan plateful. Try making this with other veg, depending on the season, squash, new potatoes, courgette, or aubergine would all work well too. 
Ingredients:
1 leek 1 fennel 1 red pepper oil for frying & roasting salt & pepper 3 garlic cloves 10g rosemary 30g black olives 1 lemon 1 tin chickpeas 125g cherry tomatoes 1 tsp fennel powder 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tsp bouillon powder 200ml passata 30g parsley olive oil 4 tortillas
Method:
Preheat your oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Trim the leek, then slice into 2cm rounds. Wash well to remove any grit. Trim the fennel, then slice into thin wedges. Deseed and dice the pepper into 2-3cm chunks. Toss the leek, fennel and pepper into a roasting tray with enough oil to coat. Season. Roast the veg for 20 mins. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic. Finely chop 1 good tbsp of rosemary leaves. Slice the olives. Finely zest ½ the lemon. Drain the chickpeas, reserving the liquid from the tin (known as aquafaba). After 20 mins, stir the rosemary, olives, tomatoes (whole), chickpeas, fennel powder, smoked paprika, bouillon powder and ½ the garlic into the roasting tray. Add the passata and ½ the aquafaba. Season. Roast for approx. 15-20 mins, until it’s all tender. Toss halfway through. Add a little more aquafaba if it looks too dry. Finely chop the parsley leaves. Gently warm 1 tbsp of olive oil in a small saucepan. Gently fry the remaining garlic for 30 secs-1 min, until softened. Make sure it doesn’t burn. Divide the garlic oil and ½ the parsley between 4 tortillas. Roll them up and wrap each in foil. 5 mins before the veg is ready, put them in the oven, straight onto the oven shelf. Check the seasoning on the veg. Serve the tortillas with the veg, garnished with remaining parsley and a little lemon zest.
