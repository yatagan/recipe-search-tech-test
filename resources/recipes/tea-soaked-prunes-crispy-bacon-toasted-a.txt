Tea-soaked prunes, crispy bacon and toasted almonds
Introduction:
The prunes and their syrup also make a great accompaniment to your muesli or porridge for breakfast, or with rice pudding or warm custard for dessert, without the bacon of course. The prunes'll need soaking overnight
Ingredients:
100g brown sugar 24 good quality prunes Â¼ cinnamon stick 1 clove 1 star anise thick strip orange zest 1 Earl Grey tea bag 4 rashers smoked bacon 24 whole almonds
Method:
To tea-soak the prunes, stir the sugar into 500ml of boiling water, add the prunes, spices and tea bag, and leave overnight. Cook the bacon, in a pan or in the oven, until crispy. Toast the almonds in the oven until golden brown. To serve, snap the bacon into 6 pieces. Cut a slit in the side of each prune, push a whole almond inside and jam in a shard of bacon. Slide a cocktail stick through the middle so your guests don't get sticky fingers.
