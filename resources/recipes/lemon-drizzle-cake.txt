Lemon drizzle cake
Introduction:
Make this easy and delectable cake with organic unwaxed lemons as you're including the rind in the mixture. Stir in a teaspoon of poppy seeds for a pretty, dappled effect. Serve with a dollop of crème fraîche or lightly whipped double cream (swirled with a little lemon curd if you have it) and a pot of tea. 
Ingredients:
200g unsalted butter, softened 200g caster sugar zest & juice of 2 lemons 3 eggs 200g self raising flour 75g caster sugar (or use granulated for a crunchier topping)
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Grease a 20cm loose bottomed cake tin using a little butter on a piece of kitchen paper. Line the tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon, until the mixture is light, pale and fluffy. Add the lemon zest and beat for another minute or two. In a separate small bowl, break the eggs and lightly beat until the yolks and whites are combined. Gradually add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, making sure the egg is mixed in each time before adding more. Sift the flour into the bowl and gently fold into the mixture until just incorporated. Do not over mix. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin and bake for about 45-55 minutes, depending on your oven. Test the cake is ready by inserting a skewer – if it comes out clean, the cake is done. Remove from the oven and prick the cake all over with a skewer or cocktail stick. Stir the lemon juice and sugar for the drizzle together in small jug. Pour over the cake in 3 or 4 batches, waiting a minute or two between each pouring. Sprinkle over a pinch or two of extra caster sugar for an extra crunchy topping if you like. Leave to cool slightly then remove the cake from the tin and cool completely on a wire cooling rack.
