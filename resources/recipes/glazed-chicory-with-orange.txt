Glazed chicory with orange
Introduction:
This recipe for chicory cooked with orange juice and a little sugar is a perfect foil to the gaminess of duck or pheasant. It also goes well with grilled fish or scallops. It's healthy and easy to prepare. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 4 heads of chicory, thinly sliced 50g caster sugar 200ml white wine grated zest & juice of 2 oranges a sprig of thyme salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a large pan, add the onion and garlic and cook over a medium heat for a few minutes, until softened but not coloured. Add the chicory, sugar, wine, orange juice and zest and thyme and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the liquid has caramelised slightly and reduced enough to coat the chicory in a light glaze. Season well and serve.
