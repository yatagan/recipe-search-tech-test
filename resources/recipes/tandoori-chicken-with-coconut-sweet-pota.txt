Tandoori chicken with coconut sweet potato mash
Introduction:
Marinated for a few hours or overnight, this tender tandoori chicken has a fantastic depth of flavour. Its spices are balanced out by the coconut coolness of the sweet potato mash. This is a fairly mild version which should appeal to children; if you prefer more of a kick, add more chilli. 
Ingredients:
200g plain yoghurt 4cm piece ginger, peeled & grated 2 garlic cloves, grated 1 tsp garam masala 2 tsp each ground cumin & coriander ½ tsp each turmeric, chilli powder & dried mint juice of 1 lemon 1 tbsp sunflower oil 4 chicken legs 600g sweet potato, peeled & diced 50g creamed coconut block salt & pepper
Method:
In a large bowl, mix the yoghurt, ginger, garlic, spices, lemon juice, oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Use a sharp knife to make 3-4 slashes in the chicken skin. Toss the chicken legs in the mixture to coat. Marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours or overnight if you can. Remove the chicken and bring it up to room temperature. Preheat oven to 230°C/Gas 8. Roast the chicken legs in a shallow baking dish for 35-45 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Meanwhile, boil the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes, until tender. Drain and mash. In a small heatproof bowl, mix the creamed coconut with 2 tablespoons of boiling water. Stir to melt the cream into a paste. Mix with the sweet potato. Season and serve with the chicken.
