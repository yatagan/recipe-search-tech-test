Pasta with rocket and feta
Introduction:
A magical vegetarian pasta dish for an evening when there's not much left in the fridge. This achieves a great complexity of texture and flavour with ingredients that you might just have kicking around the kitchen. And you can get it on the table in the time it takes the pasta to cook. 
Ingredients:
400g pasta - orechiette or fusilli would be good 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 good handfuls rocket leaves 1 tbsp lemon juice zest Â½ lemon 3 tbsp pine nuts, toasted 2-3 tbsp olive oil 8 sun-dried tomatoes, drained & chopped 200g feta cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, drain, reserving a little of the cooking liquid. Meanwhile gently cook the garlic in a little oil until softened, then add the rocket and stir until just wilted. Toss with the cooked pasta and the rest of the ingredients, with a little reserved pasta liquid if needed.
