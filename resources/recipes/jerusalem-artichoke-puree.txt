Jerusalem artichoke purée
Introduction:
This rich purée goes well with seafood, from seared scallops to pan-fried bass. It's also good with chicken, duck and pheasant. You could add a pinch of cayenne pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end. It's a good one for Jerusalem artichokes because there's no need to peel – just give them a good scrub. This recipe is also great as the base of a risotto. 
Ingredients:
juice of ½ lemon 500g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed well & roughly chopped 140ml double cream (or try using less cream and some milk instead) olive oil walnut oil or truffle oil, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water add the lemon juice and artichokes and cook until just tender. Drain. Put in a blender or food processor with the cream and season. Blitz until smooth. Add a little olive oil to taste. Add a little water or milk if the consistency is too thick. Serve drizzled with a little olive oil or some walnut or truffle oil.
