Red wine and porcini sauce
Introduction:
A delicious rich sauce. Try serving poured over rare roast beef. 
Ingredients:
15g dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in 300ml hot water (retain the water) 50g unsalted butter 4 shallots, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 sprig thyme 1 bay leaf 175ml red wine 175ml beef stock salt & pepper
Method:
First remove the porcini mushrooms from the hot water, keeping the soaking water to one side. Make the sauce by warming half the butter with the shallots, garlic, thyme and bay leaf in a pan. Cook for a few minutes until the shallots are soft but not colouring. Add a generous twist of black pepper, the porcini stock and red wine and simmer over a high heat until the liquid has reduced by half. Now chop the porcini mushrooms and add to the pan along with the beef stock and reduce again by about a third. Stir in the remaining butter. Season to taste and remove the bay leaf and thyme sprig before serving.
