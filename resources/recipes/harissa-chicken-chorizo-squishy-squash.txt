Harissa chicken, chorizo, squishy squash & black olives
Introduction:
Chicken thighs are easy to cook. If you fancy a casserole along the coq-au-vin lines, it's best to pull off the skin before cooking. There is enough fat in a thigh to keep it moist and non crispy chicken skin is a bit of a turn off. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp herby harissa paste 4 chicken thighs 600g squash, skinned & cut into wedges 3 cooking chorizo sausages, cut into quarters 2 red peppers, cut into large chunks 15 pitted black olives
Method:
preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Rub the harissa into the chicken thighs and leave to marinade for an hour. Put in a roasting dish and roast at for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Remove from the oven and add the squash, turning it in the chicken juices. Return to the oven, then after another 10 minutes add the chorizo, romano pepper and olives, and cook until the chicken is beginning to brown and the squash is squishy and slightly caramelised (about 30 minutes). Serve with rice and the juices.
