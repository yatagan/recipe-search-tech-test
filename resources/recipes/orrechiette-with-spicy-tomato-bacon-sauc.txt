Orrechiette with spicy tomato and bacon sauce
Introduction:
This full-flavoured pasta dish is brilliant when there's not much left in the fridge. In Italy pancetta would be used, but bacon will work just as well for a quick dinner. 1 teaspoon of chilli flakes will make this pretty spicy; use less if you like. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 150g bacon lardons 400g tomatoes, chopped 1 tsp dried chilli flakes 150ml red wine 400g orrechiette pasta (or other pasta) small handful fresh parsley, chopped (optional) 100g Parmesan, grated or shaved salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion, garlic and bacon and fry for 5 minutes Add the tomatoes, chillies and red wine. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly. Meanwhile cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Drain and mix with the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve tossed with the parsley, if using, and sprinkled with Parmesan.
