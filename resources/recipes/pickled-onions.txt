Pickled onions
Introduction:
Ancient Egyptians believed the believed onion's circular shape and numerous rings resemble eternal life. With this easy recipe you can worship them in the traditional British way â€“ by eating them with fish and chips, a ploughman's sandwich or cold cuts of meat. Let these mature for at least a fortnight before consuming. 
Ingredients:
1kg onions 100g salt 1.2 litre water 900ml spiced malt vinegar 1 litre vinegar 5cm cinnamon stick 15ml cloves 15ml mace blades 15ml allspice berries 15ml peppercorns 2 bay leaves
Method:
Place the unpeeled onions in a bowl (they are easier to peel after brining). Mix the salt with the water and pour it over the onions. Place a plate over the onions to ensure they are immersed in the brine. Leave for 24 hours to extract the moisture. Make a basic spiced vinegar - place the vinegar and the spices in a saucepan, cover and bring up to the boiling point. Remove from the heat and leave to steep for 2 to 3 hours, then strain. Drain the onions, then peel. Rinse them well and dry them. Pour the spiced vinegar into a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Add the onions, return to the boil and simmer for 1 minute. Drain the onions reserving the vinegar, then pack into prepared jars. Pour over the vinegar to cover the onions. Seal with airtight, vinegar proof covers.
