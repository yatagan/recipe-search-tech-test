Spinach raita
Introduction:
Try this clean, lightly flavoured sauce with dal and rice for a quick an healthy Indian-style vegetarian supper. By adjusting its thickness (add more spinach) you can also have this as a dip with crudités or pitta, or as part of a sandwich filling. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp mustard seed (black) 1 tsp cumin seeds 300g spinach, washed & stems removed 2 garlic cloves, crushed 440ml yoghurt zest & juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
‘Dry fry’ mustard and cumin seeds in a frying pan until they pop. Remove from heat. Blanch spinach quickly in boiling water, refresh, drain and squeeze out excess water. Chop spinach finely. Add garlic, spinach, lemon zest and juice, spices, and salt & pepper to the yoghurt. This is a good accompaniment to most curries (apparently our national dish nowadays) or with grilled lamb/chicken and saffron rice.
