Summer vegetable and harissa tagine
Introduction:
Full-flavoured, cheap and healthy, this North African-style recipe makes a great complete vegetarian meal. For a gluten-free version, substitute couscous for quinoa or brown rice. If you like things spicy, stir in a little extra harissa at the end, but proceed with caution as it’s got quite a kick. 
Ingredients:
100g wholemeal couscous olive oil 1 red pepper 1 green pepper 300g potatoes, scrubbed clean, skins on, cut into bite sized pieces ¼ preserved lemon 125g cherry tomatoes 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp harissa (spicy North African chilli paste) 10 pitted black olives 1 pack halloumi, cut into 2-3cm cubes handful fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the couscous in a heatproof bowl and pour over just enough boiling water to cover. Add a glug of olive oil and leave to stand. Put the whole peppers on your grill tray (no oil needed) and grill on a medium high heat until they char, turning regularly so they cook evenly. After about 15 minutes the skins will have burnt. Remove them from the grill and put in a plastic bag. Leave them to steam for 5 minutes, then peel off the skins under cold running water. Put them on your chopping board, remove the stalks and seeds and cut the flesh into thick strips. Keep to one side. Parboil the potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water for 10 minutes, then drain. Scoop the flesh out of the preserved lemon piece and discard (you don’t need this bit) and finely chop the rind. Gently warm 2 tablespoons olive oil, the garlic, harissa and preserved lemon in a heavy-based pan for 1 minute. Add the potatoes, peppers, tomatoes and olives. Season with salt and pepper. Add 100ml water, cover and cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes. Add the halloumi and cook for 5 minutes. Fluff up the couscous with a fork. Stir in the coriander leaves, check the seasoning and serve your tagine with the couscous.
