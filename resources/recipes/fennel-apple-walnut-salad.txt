Fennel, apple & walnut salad
Introduction:
A simple salad full of crispness and crunch. A few paper thin shreds of cured ham or bresaola wouldn’t cause too much of a stir here, maybe a few cooked and cooled puy lentils too. If it is BBQ time then lightly marking the fennel on the hot griddle bars before dressing adds a new smoky depth. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tsp wholegrain mustard 1 tsp runny honey 3 tbsp olive oil 1 bulb of fennel 1 crisp red apple, cored & diced 40g walnuts lightly toasted & coarsely chopped 50g salad leaf, washed 50g sharp young goat’s cheese
Method:
Make the dressing by whisking the vinegar, mustard and honey together and slowly adding the olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Alternatively put everything into an empty jam jar, screw the lid on tight and shake vigorously. Trim the fennel, removing any tough outer layers. Halve and slice into very thin wedges. Throw everything apart from the goat’s cheese together in a large bowl with a few spoons of dressing. Break the cheese over the top.
