Parsnip, carrot and cauliflower korma
Introduction:
This is a mild but warmly spicy recipe that's easily adapted to practically any vegetables you have to hand. Add the quicker cookers 5 to 10 minutes after the slow cooking root veg to make sure everything is ready at the same time. This makes a good vegetarian main, with rice or naan bread and pickle or chutney. 
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, finely chopped 4 tbsp sunflower oil 1 tbsp ground cumin 2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp turmeric 2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped 2.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & very finely chopped Â¼ tsp chilli powder 300ml Greek-style yoghurt 40g ground almonds 275g parsnips, peeled & cut into 1cm dice 350g carrots, peeled & cut into 1cm dice 275g small cauliflower florets fresh coriander or parsley, finely chopped, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
In a saucepan large enough to take all the ingredients fry the onion in the oil until golden brown. Stir in all the dry spices and when well mixed add the garlic, ginger and chilli. Stir gently for 1 minute. Stir in the yoghurt, a tablespoon at a time and then add the almonds. Cook, stirring, for 2 more minutes. Stir in 300ml of water and some salt, then add the parsnips, carrots and cauliflower. Cover and simmer gently for a final 10 minutes or so, until the vegetables are cooked. Taste and adjust seasonings. Sprinkle with coriander or parsley before serving.
