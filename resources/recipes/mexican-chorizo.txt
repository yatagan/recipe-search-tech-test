Mexican chorizo
Introduction:
In Mexico and California, chorizo often comes very lightly cured and loose as sausage meat. Itâ€™s easy to make and can be used for all manner of things from tortillas to stuffing. It needs to be left overnight for the flavours to mingle once mixed, but after that it will keep for ten days refrigerated in an airtight plastic container. 
Ingredients:
600g minced pork 1 tbsp salt 2 garlic cloves, crushed & finely chopped 1 tsp hot smoked paprika 1 tbsp plain paprika 50ml red wine
Method:
Mix all the ingredients together in a plastic container, put the lid on and leave out of the fridge overnight. The next day refrigerate and use as needed.
