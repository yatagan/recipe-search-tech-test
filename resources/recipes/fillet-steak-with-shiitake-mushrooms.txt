Fillet steak with shiitake mushrooms in red wine
Introduction:
This meal of succulent steak and mushrooms takes under 15 minutes to make and is a huge treat. Lightly steamed green beans or creamed spinach are a very good side with it. 
Ingredients:
2 fillet steaks oil for frying, e.g. vegetable 200g shiitake mushrooms, cleaned but left whole leaves from a sprig of thyme 1 tbsp port (optional) 6 tbsp red wine 40g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Lightly oil the steaks and season on both sides. Heat a heavy based pan until very hot, add the steaks and seal on both sides. For medium to medium-rare steaks you want to cook them for about 3 minutes each side, depending on their thickness. Adjust the time a couple of minutes either way for rare or well done. Remove the steaks from the pan to a plate and leave them to rest. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed and add the mushrooms, and cook for one minute only. Add the thyme leaves, port if using, and red wine. Cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, then add the butter. Serve the mushrooms over the steaks.
