Mushrooms a la Grecque
Introduction:
A la Grecque is the term for vegetables cooked in oil and seasonings then allowed to marinate and served cold. This classic mushroom dish is good as part of a mezze spread, or a light lunch or starter, perhaps with some crusty bread, and pâté or a dip. The technique works beautifully with young tender artichokes, carrots and cauliflower as well.
Ingredients:
400g mushrooms, trimmed & halved, thickly sliced if large 3 tbsp olive oil 2-3 tbsp lemon juice 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed pinch chilli flakes (optional) 1 bay leaf 2 sprigs thyme 100ml dry white wine fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped, to serve (optional) crusty bread, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Place all ingredients except parsley and bread in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes until mushrooms are tender. Leave to cool. Serve sprinkled with parsley (if using) along with crusty bread to mop up the juices. If you prefer, cover the mushrooms and refrigerate for a few days or until ready to eat.
