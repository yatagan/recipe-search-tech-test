Mooli and sesame salad
Introduction:
A fresh vegetarian cold noodle salad with strips of crunchy veg. This is good for a simple, healthy dinner or in a lunch box. Add strips of cooked chicken if you'd like more substance. A mooli, or daikon, is a mild, crunchy kind of radish. You could use ordinary radishes in its place, but include a smaller weight as they'll be more peppery. 
Ingredients:
100g rice noodles 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 mooli (about 200-250g), peeled & cut into thin batons 1 carrot, peeled & cut into thin batons 1 red pepper, de-seeded & cut into thin batons 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar (or use white wine vinegar) handful fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped
Method:
Cook the rice noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain, refresh in a bowl of cold water to cool, then drain again and toss in a bowl with the sesame oil. Add the rest of the ingredients and toss together.
