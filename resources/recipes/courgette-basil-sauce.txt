Courgette and basil sauce
Introduction:
This makes a luxuriant weeknight dinner than can be on the table in under 30 minutes. You can add bacon if you miss it, but this is a lovely fresh recipe for show-casing courgettes. Serve with whatever pasta you prefer, though fusilli's especially good at capturing the sauce. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1kg courgettes, cut in 1cm dice 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp fresh basil 150ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a pan, and gently fry the courgettes with the garlic for 20 minutes until brown. Add 2 tablespoons of water and stir well. Chop the basil and add to the pan. Stir in the double cream and cook gently to heat through. Season to taste.
