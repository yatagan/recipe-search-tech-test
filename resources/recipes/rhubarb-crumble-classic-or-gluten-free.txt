Rhubarb crumble (classic or gluten-free)
Introduction:
The traditional way to enjoy this quintessential English winter fruit, easy to make and a great excuse to eat lots of cream or custard - yum!
Ingredients:
500g rhubarb, cut into 3-4cm lengths zest & juice of 1 orange 120g caster sugar 125g (gluten-free) plain flour 125g unsalted butter 75g demerara sugar either 50g quinoa flakes & 50g rice flakes (gluten-free) or 100g rolled oats
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas Mark 4. Toss together the rhubarb, orange zest, juice and caster sugar in a 1 litre ovenproof dish. Put the flour and butter in a large bowl and rub together with your fingertips until it looks like coarse breadcrumbs (or pulse in a food processor). Stir in the sugar, quinoa and rice flakes, or oats. Spread over the rhubarb, making sure the fruit is covered. Lightly press down. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown.
