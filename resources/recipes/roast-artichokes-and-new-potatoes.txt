Roast artichokes and new potatoes
Introduction:
Artichokes and potatoes have complementary earthy flavours. This is how to make a couple of artichokes go a long way. If you can't get hold of wet garlic, just add some whole unpeeled cloves instead, which'll look nicely rustic. This dish is good eaten with fish or chicken – to be efficient you could roast a few thighs or breasts in the same tray as the potatoes. 
Ingredients:
800g new potatoes, halved 80ml olive oil sprig rosemary, chopped 2 globe artichokes 1 wet garlic bulb, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. In an ovenproof dish, mix the potatoes with the olive oil, rosemary and some seasoning. Place in the and roast for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes are starting to brown. Meanwhile, boil the artichokes whole and cut each one into eighths. Add the artichoke segments and the wet garlic to the potatoes, mix together and return to the oven for another 30 minutes, until the artichokes and potatoes are cooked through.
