Thai-style pork kebabs
Introduction:
This recipe calls for a few hours marinating, but it's worth it for the full, fiery taste. The coconut cream has a mildness that balances the salty pork and chilli beautifully. It's a bit fusion cuisine, but tzatziki makes a really good accompaniment to this. 
Ingredients:
200ml coconut cream 1 heaped tbsp Thai green curry paste 2 tsp brown sugar juice of 1 lime 1 tbsp fish sauce 1 tbsp soy sauce 600g lean pork, cut into 2.5 cm dice 3 medium red onions, cut into 12-18 wedges 3 limes, cut into 12 wedges
Method:
Mix together the coconut cream, curry paste, sugar, lime juice, fish and soy sauces in a plastic bowl. Stir the pork into the sauce and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight, or for about 3 hours at room temperature, stirring every so often. Thread the pieces of pork onto metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers, alternating with red onion and lime wedges, until all have been used up. Donâ€™t crowd them. Cook the kebabs on the BBQ or under the grill for about 10 minutes, brushing generously with the marinade for the first 5 minutes and turning until evenly browned. Culturally it might seem a little strange, but tzatziki makes a good serving partner.
