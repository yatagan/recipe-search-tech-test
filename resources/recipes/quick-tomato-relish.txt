Quick tomato relish
Introduction:
This fresh, spicy tomato relish takes moments to make. It's good on toast or bruschetta as a snack, or as an accompaniment to spicy fish dishes or any Indian food. If you'd like to reduce the spiciness, mix with a little crème fraîche and have it as a pasta sauce. 
Ingredients:
200g tomatoes, diced 1 onion, diced 4 tbsp fresh coriander, parsley or mint, chopped ½ tsp cayenne pepper ½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted & ground ¾ tsp salt 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
Method:
Mix together all the ingredients. Leave the flavours to infuse.
