One pot chicken with honey and mustard roots
Introduction:
A chicken and veg dinner in a one pot. This takes under half an hour to cook, so it's good for a quick, low effort weeknight. For total ease, you can eat this on it's own, or serve it with creamy mashed potatoes and braised greens. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 8 chicken thighs 2 onions, finely sliced 500g mixed root veg - parsnips, carrots, swede, peeled & cut into batons or chunks 4 tsp wholegrain mustard 4 tsp clear honey 300ml veg or chicken stock leaves from 2 sprigs thyme, or use Â½ tsp dried salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based casserole dish and brown the chicken (in batches if necessary). Remove the chicken from the pan and add the onion. Gently fry for 10 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan and add the root vegetables, mustard, honey and stock, thyme and salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is becoming sticky.
