Grilled watermelon, mint, whipped feta & cumin
Introduction:
The only reason to BBQ a watermelon is to add to the taste. They don’t need cooking in any real way; in fact, they’ll suffer if left on the heat for too long. It can work in sweet dishes too; just sprinkle over a little sugar in place of salt and pepper.
Ingredients:
200g feta cheese 100ml Greek yogurt olive oil 1 lemon 1 tsp cumin seeds ½ a mini watermelon small bunch of mint 1 tsp sumac
Method:
Light your BBQ – you want to get it searingly hot. Crumble the feta into a bowl. Add the yogurt, 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice. Whisk it all together until the lumps of feta break up and it becomes creamy. Taste and add a bit more lemon juice to your taste. Toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan until they smell fragrant, taking care not to burn them. Give them a bash in a pestle and mortar to break them up a bit, if you have one. If not, leave them whole. Cut the watermelon into 2cm thick slices. Rub lightly with olive oil and season with a small pinch of salt and pepper. When the BBQ is hot enough, place them straight on the griddle and cook for about 1 - 2 minutes a side, until you have dark, distinct griddle marks. Remove and cut them into an interesting array of triangles. Add a slick of whipped feta to each plate and top with a few stacked pieces of watermelon. Tear over some mint and scatter over some cumin and sumac. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
