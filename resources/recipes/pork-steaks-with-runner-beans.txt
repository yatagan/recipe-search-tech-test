Pork steaks with runner beans
Introduction:
This is a good way of pepping up runner beans - using copious quantities of lemon and garlic. 
Ingredients:
3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 large lemon, zest & juice 5 tbsp olive oil 1 sprig rosemary, leaves removed & chopped 1 pinch chilli flakes 600g boneless pork collar, cut into 4 steaks 500g runner beans, topped, tailed, destringed & chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the garlic, lemon juice and zest, olive oil, rosemary, chilli, salt and pepper together in a large bowl and add the pork steaks. Give it a stir to make sure the pork is well covered. Leave for at least an hour, turning occasionally. Remove the pork from the marinade, scraping and returning any bits of garlic, rosemary etc. Keep the marinade. Bring a pan of salted water to a vigorous boil and blanch the beans for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat a heavy frying pan to nearly smoking, and cook the pork steaks for about 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork, turn down the heat and add the beans and strained marinade to the frying pan. Lid and cook gently, stirring occasionally until the beans are cooked through. Return the pork to the pan for the last minute or so to get them back up to temperature. Serve with carbs of your choice and a wedge of lemon.
