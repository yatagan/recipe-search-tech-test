Tomato, apple & celery juice 
Introduction:
Although tomatoes are technically a fruit this juice still has a savoury edge that is balanced by the sweet apples. It is best drunk chilled. A shake of tabasco sauce will pep it up, in much the same it would in a bloody Mary . This should yield about 3-400ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier, higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge. 
Ingredients:
2 celery stalks 2 apples, cores & stalks removed 3-4 tomatoes squeeze of lemon, to taste
Method:
Put everything through the juicer apart from the lemon. Adjust with lemon to your taste.
