Peppers stuffed with pork and rosemary
Introduction:
Making the most of a little minced pork, and delicately seasoned with rosemary and garlic, this makes a good light dinner or packed lunch. Use Ramiro peppers (the long, tapering kind) if you can – they're a little more flavourful than bell peppers. 
Ingredients:
1 red pepper slug olive oil ½ a small onion, chopped sprig rosemary, leaves finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 tomato, chopped (use tinned if you don’t have any) 70-80g pork mince about 10g breadcrumbs 1 tsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C. Cut the pepper in half lengthways and remove the stalks and ribs, drizzle with oil, and place on a baking tray and bake for about 15 minutes. Heat a little oil in a pan and sweat the onion for a few mins (do not allow to colour) then add the rosemary and garlic. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring, then add the tomato. Cook for another 5 minutes, then season well and add the pork and breadcrumbs. Take the peppers out of the oven and carefully divide the filling between the two halves. Sprinkle some grated Parmesan over the top, and drizzle over a little more olive oil, then bake for a further 30 minutes.
