Mother's day stuffed tomatoes
Introduction:
What makes these so quick and easy is that they're not properly stuffed, just cut in half and piled with a topping. Eat this for a simple starter or side – it's good with grilled fish or meat. Exchange the Parmesan for another hard cheese to keep it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
50g white breadcrumbs 50g butter ½ tsp Dijon mustard pepper to season 4 tomatoes, cut in half 15g Parmesan, grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 240°C/Gas 9. Blend the breadcrumbs, butter and mustard to a paste. Season with pepper to taste. Place the tomatoes cut side up in a baking dish. Spread a little of the paste onto each tomato half. Sprinkle over the Parmesan. Bake for about 10-15 minutes.
