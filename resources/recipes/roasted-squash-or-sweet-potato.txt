Roasted squash
Introduction:
Soft and sweet, this recipe makes a warm, comforting side. It's good as a simple supper with sausages and something green; or dressed, with puy lentils, feta and salad leaves; or liquidised with a bit of stock for a quick and easy soup. Add other root veg if you have them lying around – parsnips, carrots and beetroot. 
Ingredients:
1 squash 2 onions, sliced olive oil 2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped 1 red chilli, very finely chopped 1 sprig rosemary, very finely chopped
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut squash in half lengthways. Peel and slice across into lengths about 1cm wide. Place sliced onions on shallow baking tray, lay squash slices on the onions and sprinkle with olive oil. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or until squash is just cooked. Sprinkle garlic, red chilli and rosemary over squash and return to oven for another 10 minutes, until garlic and chilli is cooked but not brown.
