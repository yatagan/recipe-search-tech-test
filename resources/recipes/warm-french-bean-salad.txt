Warm French bean salad
Introduction:
An excellent way to celebrate the year's first French beans. This is good as a side or a starter and should be eaten warm to enjoy the full beany flavour. With a few judicious additions it can be stretched into a light lunch on its own: toasted walnuts or pine nuts, shredded Serrano ham or bacon, crumbled feta, chopped basil, mint or parsley. 
Ingredients:
300g French beans, trimmed 2 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced 1 spring onion, very thinly sliced 1 tbsp sherry vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of salted boiling water, cook the beans for about 4-5 minutes until tender but with a squeak. Drain and keep to one side. In a pan, heat the oil to a medium heat. Add the garlic. Fry for a couple of minutes until golden. Add the drained beans and spring onions and fry for another minute. Season well. Remove from the heat and add the sherry vinegar. Toss all the ingredients together and serve.
