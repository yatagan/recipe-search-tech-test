Mexican salsa verde (with tomatillos)
Introduction:
You can make this with cooked tomatillos if you want a more comforting condiment, but kept raw they retain a sour freshness that's lovely for a summer’s day. If you want to try them cooked, just boil the tomatillos for 5 minutes before following the recipe. This could be your new best friend at barbecue; it lends itself to all things chargrilled – chicken, pork, white fish or summer veg. It keeps well in a jar in the fridge. 
Ingredients:
1 small red onion, finely diced zest & juice of 1 lime 1 tsp brown sugar 400g tomatillos, husks removed & rinsed well 1-2 chillies (depending on heat preference) 1 small garlic clove, minced to a paste with a pinch of salt 20g fresh coriander, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the finely diced onion with the juice and zest of the lime and the sugar, and leave to sit in a shallow bowl for 30 minutes; the acid from the lime takes away the raw edge of the onions. Meanwhile pulse the tomatillos and chilli in a food processor with a dash of water until roughly chopped, or do it by hand if you’re feeling rustic. Mix all the ingredients together and season well with a little salt, tasting as you go and adding more lime or sugar if needed.
