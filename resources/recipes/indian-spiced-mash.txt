Indian spiced mash
Introduction:
Ring the changes with your mashed spuds! Indian spices, fresh coriander and raw onion add layers of lovely flavour. This is nice as an accompaniment to curries, or eaten simple with fried sausages. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped 3 tbsp sunflower oil 1-2 garlic cloves, finely chopped ½-1 green chilli, to taste, deseeded & finely chopped ½ tsp turmeric ½ tsp ground coriander 500-600g potatoes, boiled & mashed 1 tsp mustard seeds 1 tbsp butter (use more oil if you prefer) 2 handfuls fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped salt
Method:
Sweat the onion in a frying pan in 2 tablespoons of oil until soft – about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and chopped chilli and continue cooking for 2 more minutes, then add the turmeric and coriander and cook again for 1-2 minutes. Add the onion and spice mix to the potatoes and mix thoroughly. Taste and add salt as needed. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then add the mustard seeds and cook until they start to pop. Add the butter, allow to melt and then add this too to the potatoes, along with half the coriander. Reheat if necessary and serve sprinkled with remaining coriander.
