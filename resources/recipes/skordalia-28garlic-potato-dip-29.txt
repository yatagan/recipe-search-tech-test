Skordalia (garlic potato dip)
Introduction:
This classic Greek dish is incredibly simple to make, and very versatile. You can treat it like hummus and eat it as a potent dip; serve it alongside cooked veg â€“ it goes well with beetroot, perhaps with some warm pittas; or use it as a sauce for green veg such as runner beans, or for fish. 
Ingredients:
4-6 garlic cloves, peeled 450g floury potatoes, peeled & cut into equal sized chunks 6 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp white wine vinegar fresh chives, flat-leaf parsley or coriander, black olives & oil, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the garlic with the potatoes. Drain and mash, then mix in the olive oil, vinegar and season. Garnish with the chopped herbs and olives. Nice with hot pitta bread. A couple of tablespoons of plain yoghurt makes a nice addition.
