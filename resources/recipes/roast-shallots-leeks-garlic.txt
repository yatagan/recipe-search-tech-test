Roast shallots, leeks and garlic
Introduction:
This veggie recipe is great for the spinning out the flavour of a couple of leeks. Roasting them with garlic and shallots results in a punchy side that goes well with fish and chicken. 
Ingredients:
2 leeks 6 shallots 4 garlic cloves olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut the leeks lengthways to the core and rinse under running water while fanning them. Top and tail the leeks keeping the white part whole. Take the outer leaves off the shallots and garlic cloves then place them in a roasting tin with the leeks. Drizzle over olive oil, add a little salt and pepper and put in the oven for 25 minutes, stirring them midway.
