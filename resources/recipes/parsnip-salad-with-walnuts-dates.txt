Parsnip salad with walnuts and dates
Introduction:
This easy and unusual vegetarian recipe is a good way of adding freshness to your autumn or winter eating. It's at once sweet and comforting, crunchy and light. Eating parsnips raw brings out quite a different, delicately earthy flavour to the usual slow-roasted caramel. Use young, fairly small parsnips for this if you can. 
Ingredients:
3 or 4 parsnips, peeled 4 tsp lemon juice, more to taste if required 2 tsp grated lemon zest 4 tsp clear honey 16 large dates, stones removed, halved 120ml plain yoghurt 12 walnuts, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the parsnips in half cross-wise and grate them. If they are starting to go a bit woody leave the central core out. Toss the grated parsnip with salt and pepper to taste, the lemon juice, zest and honey. Cut each date half into 4 pieces. Add these to the parsnips with the yogurt and toss well. Taste for salt and lemon, adding more if needed. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, then toss with the walnuts.
