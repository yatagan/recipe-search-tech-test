Roast beef blinis
Introduction:
A slice of rare beef on a warm blini with a dab of apple and horseradish sauce takes a lot of beating. 
Ingredients:
150g strong white flour 150g buckwheat flour ½ tsp each salt & sugar 1 tsp dried yeast 120ml each milk, water & natural yoghurt 2 eggs, separated 50g butter, plus more for frying rare-cooked roast beef slices
Method:
Mix the flours, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl and leave in a warm place. Mix the liquids together in a saucepan, add the butter and heat until the butter melts. Allow to cool to about 40°C. Beat the egg yolks into the liquid and pour into the flour. Give it a good stir, cover and leave in a warm place for a couple of hours – or in the fridge overnight. Whisk the egg whites. You want them reasonably stiff but you need to be able to fold them into the batter without knocking all the air out. Brush a heavy frying plan with a mixture of oil and butter and start frying your blinis, about two tablespoons at a time. As with drop scones, turn when the top of the blini starts bubbling. Keep them warm in the oven until they are all cooked. Add a dollop of apple and horseradish sauce and sliced beef to serve.
