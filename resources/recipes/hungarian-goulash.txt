Hungarian goulash
Introduction:
This spicy meat stew makes a lovely dinner on a chilly evening. The only indispensible ingredients are paprika and onions; pork can be substituted for beef and slight variations in quantity or ingredients will do no harm. The contrast between cool tangy sour cream and rich meat is what elevates this to real perfection – so don't leave that out! 
Ingredients:
olive oil 1 kg diced pork 2 onions, finely sliced 2 fresh chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2 tbsp mild smoked paprika 2 tbsp ground caraway seeds bunch fresh oregano or marjoram 5 red peppers, sliced 400g tinned tomatoes splash red wine vinegar soured cream fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat the oil in a large casserole and brown the pork then put it aside. Add the onions, chilli, paprika, caraway and herbs and cook gently for 10 minutes, until the onions are golden. Add peppers, tomatoes and browned pork, stir well to coat in the hot mixture and pour in the vinegar and enough water to just cover the meat. Put in the oven for 3 hours. Towards the end of the cooking time veg such as carrots, parsnips and potatoes could be added. When the meat is cooked it will be tender and break apart easily. If it’s not done return to the oven for a little while longer. Serve with rice, and garnish with soured cream and parsley.
