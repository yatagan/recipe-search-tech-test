Devilled tomatoes
Introduction:
To devil something is a very English way of saying ‘add spice and heat’: if the end product doesn’t make your nose sweat then you’re not doing it right! This devilling sauce works well with many different kinds of grilled or fried meat and fish too.
Ingredients:
6 ripe tomatoes olive oil 1 tsp light brown sugar 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp English mustard powder ½ tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp red wine vinegar salt
Method:
Heat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the tomatoes in half, rub lightly with oil and place in a roasting tin, cut side up. Mix all the devilling ingredients together and season well with salt. Spoon the sauce over the tomatoes and roast in the oven for 15–20 minutes until cooked through and starting to colour. Check halfway and spoon any sauce that has collected in the bottom of the tin back over the tomatoes.
