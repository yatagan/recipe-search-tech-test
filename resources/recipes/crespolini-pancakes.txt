Crespolini pancakes
Introduction:
Stuffed pancakes cooked in a hot oven until the cheese on top is melting and golden brown. These go well with a crisp green salad and a glass of white wine. Use a hard cheese substitute for Parmesan to keep them vegetarian. Makes 8 pancakes. See our basic pancakes mix for a simple recipe. 
Ingredients:
250g finely chopped leftover cooked greens e.g. spinach or chard small knob of butter 120g Parmesan, grated, & a little extra for grilling a little nutmeg, grated 8 small pancakes 350g ricotta salt & pepper
Method:
Gently warm the greens with the butter in a frying pan. Stir in the Parmesan and a little grated nutmeg. Season. Spread a little of the greens mixture on each half of the pancakes and the other half with a little ricotta. Fold the pancakes in half, then into quarters. Put on a grill tray and heat your grill to medium. Sprinkle a little more Parmesan over the pancakes and grill until the cheese has melted and the pancakes have crisped slightly.
