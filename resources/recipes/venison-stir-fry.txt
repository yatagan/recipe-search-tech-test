Venison stir-fry
Introduction:
This success of this recipe lies in the quick, Asian-style marinade. Chop up the rest of your veg while the meat soaks up the gingery spice and salty soy sauce, them sizzle everything together for a flavourful and easy dinner. Serve over rice or noodles, with a generous topping of fresh coriander, toasted nuts and lime juice. 
Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp crushed coriander seeds 1cm fresh ginger, grated 2 tbsp dark soy sauce 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 1 small red onion, finely diced 400g venison stir fry 1 tbsp sunflower oil 8 spring onions, cut into 1cm lengths 1 stick celery, thinly sliced 1 carrot, sliced into batons 100g green beans, sliced in half 3 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 3 tbsp cashews or peanuts, lightly toasted 1 lime, cut into wedges
Method:
Mix together the garlic, coriander, ginger, soy and chilli sauces, and the red onion. Add the venison and marinate for 30 minutes. Drain well, saving the marinade. Heat a frying pan or wok to a high heat. Stir fry the venison for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and replace with the spring onions, celery, carrot, green beans and marinade juices. Fry until starting to soften. Just before serving, return the meat to the pan and toss to combine. Serve sprinkled with fresh coriander and nuts, with a lime wedge.
