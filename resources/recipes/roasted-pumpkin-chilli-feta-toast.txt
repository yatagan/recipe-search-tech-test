Roasted pumpkin and chilli feta toast
Introduction:
Toast topped with a delicious trio of salty feta, sweet roast pumpkin and hot chilli. This is a quick lunch or light supper dish with a side of crisp green salad. 
Ingredients:
120g pumpkin, peeled & diced olive oil 50g feta cheese ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes ¼ tsp dried herbs – use oregano, marjoram or mixed herbs 1 large piece of toast (sourdough is good) salad leaves, to serve
Method:
Heat the oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Toss the pumpkin in olive oil in a baking dish, and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, until soft and just turning golden. While the pumpkin is cooking, place the feta on a piece of foil in a small baking dish. Wrap the sides of the foil up to surround the cheese. In a small bowl, mix the chilli flakes, dried herbs and 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Pour over the feta and bake in the oven for 10 minutes (or grill for about 5 minutes). Mash the pumpkin with a fork, spread over the toast and spread over the feta, drizzling over any juices from the foil. Serve with salad leaves.
