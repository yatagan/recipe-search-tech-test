Potato, radish and chervil warm salad
Introduction:
With bright green leaves that look a little like carrot tops, chervil has a mild, sweet aniseed flavour that works elegantly in this easy, light potato salad. If you can't find it, use parsley instead for a more robust finish. This goes well with simply cooked chicken and fish. 
Ingredients:
veg stock or bouillon 800g new or salad potatoes, cut in ½ or ¼ if large 12 radishes (keep their tops if bunched), trimmed of long roots 2 tbsp sherry vinegar 50g butter pinch sugar 2 tbsp chervil leaves (or use parsley)
Method:
Bring a pan of veg stock to the boil (or a pan of water with a little bouillon). Add the potatoes and cook until just tender, about10-12 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a serving bowl. Add the radishes and cook for 3-4 minutes, depending on size. Remove and add to the potatoes (cut some of the larger ones in half if you like). Drain off most of the stock, leaving about 3 tablespoons. Add the vinegar, butter and sugar to the pan. Boil to reduce a little, until almost syrupy, wilting in any radish tops (if you have them) at the end. Toss with the potatoes, radishes and chervil. Season to taste.
