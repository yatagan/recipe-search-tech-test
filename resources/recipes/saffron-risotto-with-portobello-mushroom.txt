Saffron risotto with Portobello mushrooms
Introduction:
Otherwise know as risotto alla Milanese, this saffron-flavoured risotto is good on its own, but for a bit of extra flavour (and a portion of your five a day) serve it with Portobello mushrooms, one or two per person, depending on how hungry you are. If you've got ordinary mushrooms in your box, use those instead. Otherwise, make a big salad as your accompaniment. 
Ingredients:
50g butter, plus a little extra to serve 1 tbsp olive oil 200g onions, finely chopped 300g arborio risotto rice 100ml dry white wine pinch of saffron strands (about Â¼ tsp) 750ml hot veg stock 75g grated Parmesan 2 tbsp oil for frying, vegetable or sunflower 2-4 Portobello mushrooms
Method:
Heat the oil and butter in a large, heavy based pan and gently fry the onions for about 10 minutes. Add the risotto rice, stir to combine and heat for another couple of minutes, until the rice has started to turn translucent. Increase the heat, add the white wine and cook for one minute. Add the saffron strands then gradually add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously, until it has been absorbed and the rice is cooked but still has some bite. Remove from the heat and stir in two thirds of the Parmesan and a knob of butter. Season to taste. Sprinkle with the rest of the Parmesan to serve, with the mushrooms on the side. To cook the mushrooms, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan and cook the mushrooms on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until just tender. Season well.
