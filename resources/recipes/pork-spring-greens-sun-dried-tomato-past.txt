Pork, spring greens and sun-dried tomato pasta 
Introduction:
This rich, sunny pasta recipe takes under 20 minutes to make and is a brilliant work night dinner. If you don't have pork mince, squeeze out the insides of some Italian-style sausages instead. Or if you'd like a vegetarian version, skip the pork and add a few more tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of crème fraîche. 
Ingredients:
250g penne pasta 2 tbsp olive oil 350g pork mince 250g spring greens or kale, tough stalks removed & discarded, leaves roughly chopped 12 sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped leaves from a large sprig thyme or 1 tsp dried thyme. 4 tbsp Parmesan, grated olive oil, for drizzling
Method:
In a large pan of salted boiling water, cook the penne according to the packet instructions. Drain and reserve the cooking water. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the mince and cook on a low to medium heat for about 6 or 7 minutes, until just cooked through. Add the spring greens or kale, sun-dried tomatoes and herbs. Cook for another minute, stirring occasionally, then add a couple of ladles of the pasta cooking water. Simmer for another couple of minutes or so, until the greens have wilted and the liquid has reduced. Add the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine and serve with a drizzle of olive oil or some of the sun-dried tomato oil.
