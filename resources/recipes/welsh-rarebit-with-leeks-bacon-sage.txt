Welsh rarebit with leeks, bacon and sage
Introduction:
This Welsh rarebit is good for lunch, tea or dinner. You can use any cheese you have instead or as well as Cheddar – Lancashire and Caerphilly are good additions. You can also take your pick of bread – anything from wholegrain to foccacia. Omit the bacon and add a little extra salt if you want to make this vegetarian, and leave out the cayenne/paprika if you don't like heat. 
Ingredients:
200g Cheddar, grated 1 tsp English mustard powder 75ml ale 1 egg, beaten splash Worcestershire sauce pinch cayenne pepper or paprika 1 tbsp oil 200g leeks, sliced 3 sage leaves, shredded 3 bacon rashers 4 slices bread (brown or white) salt & pepper
Method:
Combine the cheese, mustard powder, ale, egg, Worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper, if using, in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a frying pan, and gently fry the leeks for 5 minutes. Add the sage and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the leeks are soft. Turn the heat up, add the bacon and fry until cooked, then season to taste (pepper only, the bacon provides enough saltiness). Toast the bread on both sides and spread over the cheese mixture, right to the edges. Grill until the mixture has risen up and is turning golden then serve immediately with the leeks.
