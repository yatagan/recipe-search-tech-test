Root veg topped shepherd's pie
Introduction:
Rich, aromatic lamb and tender carrots topped with creamy mashed root veg. Shepherd's pie began as an improvised dish for using up the remains of the Sunday roast, but it's worth making from scratch to enjoy for dinner on a cold evening. This is a good way of using up the last root veg in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
500g root veg, whatever you have, peeled & chopped 75g butter, melted (reserve a little for brushing the finished pie) a splash of milk 1 tbsp oil for frying 900g minced lamb 1 large onion, chopped 2 carrots, peeled & diced 2 tbsp plain flour 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 2 sprigs fresh thyme leaves, or use 1 tsp dried 350ml stock
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. In a large pan of boiling water, cook the root veg until tender. Drain and mash with the butter and milk, then season to taste. In a large heavy-based pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, then add the lamb and fry until browned. Remove from the pan and add the onion and another tablespoon of oil. Fry for 5-6 minutes, until the onion is translucent then return the lamb to the pan, along with the carrots and flour. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly. Add the tomato purée, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and slowly simmer for about 20 minutes. Transfer to a baking dish and spread the mashed roots over the top. Brush with the reserved butter, and bake in the oven until the top is golden (around 15-25 minutes, depending on your oven).
