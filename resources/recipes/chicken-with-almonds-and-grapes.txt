Chicken with almonds and grapes
Introduction:
Chicken gently fried until rich and succulent, then combined with a creamy but sharp almond sauce and sweet, juicy grapes. This quick delicious dish makes a good weeknight dinner. Pair with a green salad and new potatoes, light pasta or rice. 
Ingredients:
100g flaked or whole blanched almonds 2 tbsp sherry vinegar 400 ml water 4 tbsp olive oil 500g diced chicken 8 garlic cloves, skin on 40 seedless grapes 2 bay leaves 100ml fino sherry
Method:
Grind the almonds to a fine paste, then slowly add the vinegar and 250ml of water, until the paste has a smooth consistency. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the garlic cloves for 3-4 minutes on either side. Remove. Season the chicken and fry in the pan, keeping it on the move until it begins to colour (about 5 minutes). Add the grapes, garlic and bay leaves and cook for another minute or so. Add the sherry, turn down to a simmer and cook for a further 5 minutes. Stir in the ground almond puree and slowly add the rest of the water until you have a nice creamy consistency. Serve immediately.
