Moussaka with Mediterranean vegetables
Introduction:
Moussaka made with more vegetables than lamb for a lighter dinner. Fresh Mediterranean-type vegetables add colour and balance the richness of the lamb. A lavish addition of fresh garden mint gives the dish a summery lift. Eat with a green salad, or a Greek-style tomato and feta salad. Any leftovers are great re-heated and eaten as pasta sauce.
Ingredients:
1 aubergine, trimmed & cut into 1cm dice 1 red pepper, deseeded & cut into 1cm dice 1 courgette, trimmed, halved & sliced 3 tbsp olive oil 600g minced lamb 1 onion, chopped 1 tbsp plain flour 100ml white wine 4 tomatoes, cut into 1cm dice 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 tbsp fresh mint, chopped for the sauce: 40g butter 40g plain flour 350ml milk 40g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Toss the diced aubergine, red pepper and courgette in the olive oil, (add a pinch of chilli flakes too if you like some heat) and season with salt and pepper. Spread on a roasting tray and cook in a hot oven for about 30 minutes until tinged with colour. Fry off the lamb in a dry oven proof pan to brown it lightly. Spoon away excess fat and add the chopped onion - continuing to cook over gentle heat for a further 5 minutes - then stir in the flour. Add the white wine, chopped tomatoes, tomato purée and some salt and pepper and continue to cook over the lowest heat whilst the vegetables roast. Remove the meat from the stove and fold in the vegetables together with chopped mint. Gently pat the surface to level. Reduce the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Melt butter and flour together with some seasoning until foaming, cook for a couple of minutes then pour in the milk, whisking until it forms a smooth, thick sauce. Remove from heat and stir in the grated Parmesan then pour over the surface of the moussaka. Bake for 25-30 minutes to golden and serve with crisp salad leaves and crusty bread.
