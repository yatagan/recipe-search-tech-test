Stoved potatoes with garlic and coriander
Introduction:
This is a lovely way to cook both new and old potatoes. The result is something firmer, healthier and more 'potatoey' that roast spuds â€“ but just as delicious. These'll go with anything from roast meat to fish and vegetables. The recipe can be adapted by using butter instead or as well as oil, or exchanging the coriander for parsley or mint. 
Ingredients:
450g new potatoes or waxier man-crop potatoes (e.g. Cara) 1 garlic bulb 3 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
If the potatoes are very small, leave them as they are. If medium-sized, cut in half or quarters - all the chunks should be about the same size so that they cook evenly. If using main-crop potatoes peel, but leave whole. Put the potatoes and garlic into a heavy frying-pan in a single layer. Don't try to force them in too tightly because you have to be able to turn them. If you've got a few bits too many then leave them out. Season with salt and pepper then add 6 tablespoons of water. Drizzle over the olive oil. Cook, covered, over a low heat for 40 minutes, shaking the pan and stirring occasionally until potatoes and garlic are very tender and patched with brown. By then the water should have been absorbed. If not, uncover the pan and boil it off. Once they are done, sprinkle over the coriander and serve.
