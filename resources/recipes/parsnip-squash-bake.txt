Parsnip and squash bake
Introduction:
This easy-to-make, creamy vegetarian dish is rich enough to be eaten as a main, perhaps with a crisp green salad. If you haven't got squash in your veg box, try using carrots instead. For a lighter dinner, use half cream and half veg stock or milk. 
Ingredients:
400ml double cream 1 small onion or shallot, finely chopped 2 sprigs thyme, 1 stripped of leaves 20g butter 4 large parsnips, peeled & thinly sliced ½ medium butternut squash, peeled, deseeded & thinly sliced small handful hard cheese, (Parmesan, Gruyère or a mature Cheddar), grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3. Place the cream, onion or shallot and the thyme sprig into a small pan. Slowly heat. Remove from the heat just before it boils and leave to cool. Strain and discard the onion and thyme. Butter a gratin or baking dish. Layer the parsnip and squash in the dish and pour over the cream. Scatter with thyme leaves and cheese. Bake for 1 hour until tender and golden.
