Wet garlic salad
Introduction:
This is a light but whole-meal kind of salad that's brilliant for a healthy vegetarian lunch. Wet (or green) garlic is freshly-harvested garlic that hasn’t been hung up to dry. It’s sweeter, milder and less pungent than the usual kind and is lovely sliced straight into salads. 
Ingredients:
a little oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower small handful wet garlic, finely sliced 40g pasta, cooked, preferably orecchiette or another small pasta 40g white beans, cooked, e.g. cannellini or haricot (drained, tinned beans are fine to use) juice ½ lemon large handful salad leaves or watercress 2 tbsp feta cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
In a small frying pan, heat the oil and fry the wet garlic for a couple of minutes, until just softened slightly. Remove and drain on kitchen paper, and leave to cool. Place in a bowl and toss with the pasta, beans, lemon juice, lettuce and just enough olive oil to coat the salad. Season with pepper and transfer to a serving bowl. Crumble over the feta cheese to serve.
