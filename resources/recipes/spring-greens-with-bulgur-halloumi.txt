Spring greens with bulghur and halloumi
Introduction:
This is a healthy, quick and adaptable vegetarian meal with a lovely balance of robust spring greens, spiced, fluffy bulghur and salty halloumi. You could use any other grain – or quinoa – instead of bulgur, and any green – chard, spinach, kale – in place of spring greens. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly. 
Ingredients:
1 small onion, finely chopped 1 bulb wet garlic, finely sliced or 2 cloves dried (normal) garlic, finely chopped olive oil 200g bulghur wheat 1 tsp ground cumin 350-400ml hot veg or chicken stock 200g halloumi cut into ½cm slices 200-300g spring or summer greens, shredded juice of 1 lemon handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, sweat the onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons of oil until soft. Add the bulgur wheat and cumin and fry for about 2 minutes more, then carefully add the hot stock and stir well. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 15 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until cooked. Place the sliced halloumi in a bowl and toss in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Heat a griddle or heavy frying pan until fairly hot while you cook the greens. If your pan is large enough, add the greens to the bulgur with 2 tablespoons more water if the bulgur looks dry. Cover the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes until the greens are tender. If you don’t have space in the pan, steam the greens separately and add to the cooked bulgur. Fry the halloumi in a griddle or frying pan for a minute or two each side. Place the bulgur and greens on a large platter with the halloumi on top. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Scatter over parsley and serve.
