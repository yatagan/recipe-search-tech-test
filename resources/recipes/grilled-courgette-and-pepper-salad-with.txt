Grilled courgette and pepper salad with feta and mint
Introduction:
This vegetarian grilled salad is very easy to make. It could be spun out into full meal by adding a tin of butter beans or having a crusty loaf of ciabatta alongside. Try to use courgettes that are nice and firm and not too big. 
Ingredients:
450g small-medium courgettes 5 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp lemon juice 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed (optional) 2 red peppers 2-3 tbsp fresh mint, roughly chopped 100g feta cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Split the courgettes in half lengthwise. Spread out in a colander, and sprinkle lightly with salt. Leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour to drain. Rinse and pat dry on kitchen paper. Brush with a little of the olive oil, then grill, turning, until browned and tender. While they are grilling, mix the remaining olive oil with the lemon juice and garlic, if using, and season with pepper and a little salt. Taste and adjust seasoning. As soon as the courgettes are cooked, cut into 2.5cm lengths and toss in the dressing. Quarter the peppers and remove seeds and white membrane. Grill, skin-side to heat, put in a bowl covered in clingfilm and leave until cool enough to handle. Strip off the skins and cut into strips. Add to the courgettes, with the mint. Stir and leave to cool completely. To serve, spoon into a dish and scatter with feta cheese.
