Smoked trout and French bean tart
Introduction:
An exquisite combination of smoky fish and fresh green beans in a light, creamy custard. This makes a great main for a summer meal, and only needs accompanying with a green salad. If you want to cut corners, use shop-bought pastry instead of making your own. 
Ingredients:
for the pastry: 175g plain flour 125g cold butter, cubed pinch of salt 1 tsp caster sugar 2-3 tbsp cold water for the filling: 4 eggs 150ml crème fraîche 2 heaped tbsp fresh dill, roughly chopped 100g smoked trout, flaked 200g French beans, topped & tailed, cut into 1-2 cm pieces 50g Gruyère cheese (or other hard cheese), grated salt & pepper
Method:
To make the pastry, put all the ingredients except the water in a food processor and blitz until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Gradually add the water, until the mixture comes together and forms a smooth dough (you may only need 2 tablespoons of water, so add carefully). Gently make into a ball shape, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Remove the pastry from the fridge and roll out on a floured work surface, until just thin enough to line a 24cm flan tin. Cover the pastry with baking parchment and fill with ceramic baking beans or uncooked rice. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans and continue to cook for another 5-10 minutes (do not let the pastry brown), then remove from the oven and leave to cool. Make the filling: In a large bowl, crack the eggs. Add the crème fraîche and lightly beat together. Add the dill, smoked trout, beans and cheese. Season and stir gently to combine all the ingredients. Fill the pastry case with the mixture, return to the oven and cook for a further 30-40 minutes, or until just set and turning golden on top.
