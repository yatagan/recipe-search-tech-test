Purple sprouting broccoli with bagna cauda
Introduction:
This makes a lovely light lunch with some crusty bread, or serve it as a dip at a party. If you don't have broccoli, try other crudités: cauliflower, celery, carrots, peppers and fennel work well. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic head, cloves separated & peeled 200ml milk 1 tin anchovy fillets – salted if you can find them 100g softened butter olive oil, to taste 300 purple sprouting broccoli, cut into florets
Method:
In a small pan, gently simmer the garlic in the milk until soft (about 15 minutes). Blend together in a food processor with the anchovies until smooth. Slowly add the butter, and drizzle in the olive oil to taste. Pour into a bowl. Either dip the broccoli raw into the bagna cauda, or blanch it in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, then blanch and refresh.
