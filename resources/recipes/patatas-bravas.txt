Patatas bravas
Introduction:
This very more-ish snack is good with a glass of red or a chilled Spanish beer. Enjoy it either as part of a tapas spread or as a side dish. This is often served with mayonnaise or aioli. 
Ingredients:
900g potatoes, cut into 2cm pieces 5 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp tomato purée 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp cayenne pepper salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Steam the potatoes over boiling water for 5 minutes until barely tender. Drain for a few moments and then add to a large bowl. Combine the remaining ingredients, pour over the potatoes and toss gently to coat. Spread the potatoes in a single layer in a roasting pan. Bake in the oven, turning every so often for 25-30 minutes until they become a rich gold colour and slightly blackened at the edges. Tip into a warm bowl, spear the potatoes with toothpicks and serve immediately with a selection of dips.
