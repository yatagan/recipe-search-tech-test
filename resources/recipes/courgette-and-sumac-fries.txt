courgette and sumac fries
Introduction:
Dark red ground sumac berries have a tangy, lemony kick that works well with courgettes. Eat these instead of potato chips, as a side dish to salmon or chicken or with a barbecue. 
Ingredients:
4 large courgettes 1 litre veg oil 500ml milk 500g plain flour 1 tbsp sumac salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the courgettes lengthways into very thin strips, then into matchsticks. Heat a deep fat fryer to 190°C, or fill a large saucepan with oil up to halfway and heat to 190°C, preferably using a cooking thermometer. Or test a cube of bread added to the hot oil; it should turn golden in 40-50 seconds. Dip the courgette in the milk, then flour. Transfer to the oil and cook for 3 minutes until golden (in batches if needs be). Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with sumac and season with salt and pepper.
