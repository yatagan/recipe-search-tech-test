Sprout top and sesame spring rolls
Introduction:
Brussels sprouts makes a very English addition to this Asian classic: stir-fried veggies and noodles nestled together in wrapping papers and fried until golden and crisp. For a lighter morsel, brush your rolls with oil and bake at 180C for 15 minutes, turning them over halfway through. Meat-eaters can add in cooked prawns, or shredded cooked duck or chicken. 
Ingredients:
2cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 bunch spring onions, finely sliced 1 head sprout tops, stalks removed, leaves shredded 1 tbsp sesame seeds 100g rice vermicelli, boiled in water for 5 mins & well drained 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tbsp mirin, optional 1 handful coriander, finely chopped spring roll wrappers vegetable oil, for frying
Method:
Fry the ginger, garlic and chilli in the oil in a wok on a medium heat. Before they colour add the spring onion and sprout tops and stir fry until everything starts to wilt. Add the sesame seeds and toss. Cook for a further few minutes Add the noodles and all the rest of the ingredients. Stir really well. Wrap the mixture in the spring roll wrappers and fry gently in vegetable oil until golden brown and crispy on all sides.
