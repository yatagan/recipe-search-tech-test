Cheat's cassoulet
Introduction:
If you have some lamb left over you could go for a quick cheatâ€™s cassoulet. 
Ingredients:
330g sausages 250g leftover braised lamb 2 tbsp duck or goose fat (optional but worth it), or use lard, butter or olive oil 1 small onion, sliced 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced 2 large tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 bay leaf 1 sprig thyme 600g cooked haricot beans (250g uncooked) for the topping: 1 clove garlic 1 tbsp flat leaf parsley 2 slices bread, cut in chunks
Method:
Heat a frying pan and colour the sausages on all sides. While the sausages are browning heat 1 tablespoon of fat in a lidded casserole and fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the tomatoes and leave to simmer. When the sausages are browned, add them to the casserole, with the bay leaf, thyme and leftover lamb. Unless the tomatoes are very juicy you may want to add a little stock or water. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the beans and stir. Season lightly and simmer with the lid on for a further 10 minutes. For the topping, put the garlic, parsley and bread chunks in a food processor and blend to a crumb consistency. Heat 1 tablespoon of fat in the frying pan. Sprinkle in the breadcrumb mixture and cook, stirring gently for a couple of minutes. Remove the lid from the cassoulet, sprinkle on the breadcrumbs, pressing down lightly with a wooden spoon, and place under the grill or in a hot oven until the crumbs begin to crisp and hopefully, in true cassoulet fashion, the liquid begins to bubble through. Serve with a green salad.
