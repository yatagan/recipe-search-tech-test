Roasted purple sprouting broccoli with lemon, chilli & garlic
Introduction:
On the surface roasting doesn’t seem to fit, far too brute a method for such a delicate flower, but it is the speed of cooking that is the saving grace. Stalks should be just tender and very slightly coloured. If the florets have burnt black then it is back to the drawing board, watch them carefully. 
Ingredients:
250g purple sprouting broccoli 1 thumb sized red chilli, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped ½ lemon, zested & juiced salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 7. Split the broccoli down into smaller and more manageable pieces, if the stalks are particularly tough remove the outer layer with a peeler. Put the broccoli onto a shallow oven tray, toss in some light olive oil and season with salt. Roast for 4 minutes. Add the chilli, garlic and lemon zest, mix very well, pop back in the oven to continue roasting for a further 3-4 minutes or until the broccoli is done. Finish with a dash of lemon juice and a pinch more salt if needed.
