Squash and beer mustard soup
Introduction:
This soup pairs sweet squash with tangy mustard for a quick, straightforward vegetarian meal. If you can't find beer mustard (wholegrain mustard blended with ale and chilli), use any other wholegrain kind and add a pinch of chilli as well. Eat with a chunk of crusty bread for dunking. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion, chopped (or use a leek) 750g squash, diced 1 litre veg stock 125ml milk 125ml cream 2 tbsp beer mustard 2 tbsp parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and fry for 8 minutes on a gentle heat, stirring now and then. Add the squash and stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the squash is tender. Blitz in a food processor or blender. Return to the pan. Add the milk and cream and reheat gently. Stir in the mustard to taste and season. Serve with the chopped parsley to garnish.
