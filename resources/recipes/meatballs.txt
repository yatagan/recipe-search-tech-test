Meatballs
Introduction:
If you're stumped for dinner inspiration, making a few meatballs can be very therapeutic after a day at work. A tablespoon of yoghurt or crème fraiche to counteract the sweetness of the tomato works a treat. At a pinch, you could substitute a tin of tomatoes for the tomato sauce. Or of course, make your own. This recipe is easy to scale up. Eat it alone, or with spaghetti and a green salad. 
Ingredients:
350g minced beef 1-2 tbsp breadcrumbs splash milk 1 tbsp Parmesan, coarsely grated 1 tbsp flat leaf parsley, chopped 1 onion, finely chopped oil to cook jar tomato sauce 1 tbsp yoghurt or crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the beef, breadcrumbs, milk, Parmesan and parsley. Sauté the onion for 5 minutes, then add to the beef mix and season well. Mix with your hands or a wooden spoon and form into small balls (damp hands are definitely best for this). Quickly brown in oil, transfer to a small casserole dish (or saucepan with a lid) and add the tomato sauce and yoghurt. Simmer gently for 20 minutes.
