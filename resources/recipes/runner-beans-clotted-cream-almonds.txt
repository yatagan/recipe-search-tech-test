Runner beans with clotted cream and almonds
Introduction:
'I had something resembling this dish at Nathan outlawâ€™s fish kitchen in Port Isaac. Seems like a decadent way to eat some beans but I manage to convince myself that our clotted cream is from grass fed cows and therefore more or less a vegetable by proxy. The heat of the just-cooked beans collapses the cream into an unctuous sauce. This is our version.' (Guy Watson)
Ingredients:
30g flaked almonds 200g runner beans clotted cream salt
Method:
Put a deep pan of salted water on to boil. Lighly toast the almonds, in the oven or a dry frying pan until just coloured. Top and tail the beans. Remove the string from each side. Slice very finely at an angle. Cook the beans in the water for 3-4 minutes until tender, remove and drain well. Transfer to a serving bowl, add a generous blob of clotted cream. Break over the toasted almonds and add a pinch of salt. Mix and serve immediately.
