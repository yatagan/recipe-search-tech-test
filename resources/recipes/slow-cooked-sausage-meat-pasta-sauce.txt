Slow cooked sausage meat pasta sauce
Introduction:
As well as making a ‘grown up’ alternative to bolognese, it also makes a great pasta al forno or lasagne. 
Ingredients:
350/500g pork mince 1 tsp fennel seeds olive oil 2 red onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 dried chillies, crumbled (or use chilli flakes) 2 bay leaves large glass red wine 2 tins chopped tomatoes nutmeg 100g Parmesan, grated 250ml double cream or crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the pork with the fennel seeds and season well. If you are ahead of the game, compact in a bowl and refrigerate overnight - this will give a slightly sausagey, lumpy texture. Fry in a flameproof casserole dish in olive oil for 5 minutes, stirring continuously. Add the onion, garlic, chilli, and bay leaves, and fry gently for 30 minutes. Turn up the heat and add the red wine. Stir for a couple of minutes, then add the chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil, allow some of the liquid to evaporate, then put on a lid and simmer for 1 hour. Grate in some nutmeg, most of the Parmesan and the cream/crème fraîche and remove from the heat. Stir well and check the seasoning. Serve with pasta, the rest of the Parmesan and a green salad.
