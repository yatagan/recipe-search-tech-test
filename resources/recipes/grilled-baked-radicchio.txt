Grilled and baked radicchio
Introduction:
Cooking radicchio sweetens and mellows its slightly astringent flavour. This is good as part of a range of antipasti, alongside pork chops, chicken or fish, chopped up in pasta or tossed in a salad with fresh leaves. 
Ingredients:
1 large radicchio head 6 tbsp olive oil 100g pancetta or smoked bacon 125g Fontina or Gruyere cheese in thin slices salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat grill to medium and oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Remove any old outer leaves from the radicchio and trim the stems. Cut into eight pieces and lay on a baking tray. Brush with olive oil and season, put under the grill and cook gently for 15 minutes. Brush with more oil and check that the leaves are not burning. Remove from the grill and lay a slice of pancetta and a slice of cheese on each piece and sprinkle on some pepper. Put in the oven for 5-8 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
