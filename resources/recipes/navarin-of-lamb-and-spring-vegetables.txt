Navarin of lamb and spring vegetables
Introduction:
A navarin in a French lamb stew made with seasonal veg. This late spring (or early summer, depending on the weather) version contains so many vegetables that it is a meal in itself. Serve with a green salad and some decent bread to mop up the juices. 
Ingredients:
1kg boneless shoulder of lamb, cut into 2cm dice 25g butter 1 tbsp plain flour 1 tbsp tomato purée about 1 litre chicken or lamb stock 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tsp sugar 1 bouquet garni (a sprig of rosemary, a sprig of thyme & a bay leaf, tied together) 8 new potatoes, scrubbed & halved 8 carrots, scrubbed, halved if large 5 turnips, peeled & cut into quarters (or left whole if they are very small) 8 small onions or shallots, or 2 large onions cut into quarters 200g peas (frozen are acceptable) 200g broad beans (optional) 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper and leave for 1 hour. Heat the butter in a large, heavy-based pan, add the lamb (in batches if necessary) and cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until browned all over. Add the flour and cook, stirring, over a low heat for about 4 minutes. Add the tomato purée and then gradually stir in half the stock until you have a smooth sauce. Add the garlic, sugar and bouquet garni, plus enough of the remaining stock just to cover the lamb. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Add the root vegetables and onions and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, until tender. Skim off any surface fat, season to taste and add the peas, and the broad beans, if using. Simmer for 5 minutes, then scatter with the parsley and serve.
