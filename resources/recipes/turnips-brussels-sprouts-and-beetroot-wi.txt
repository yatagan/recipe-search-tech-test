Turnips, Brussels sprouts and beetroot with hazelnuts
Introduction:
The success of this unusual vegetarian main relies on cooking the different vegetables well and finishing them off with a really good wine vinegar. If you don't have any of the root veg, carrots and parsnips make good alternatives. Couscous makes a good, quick accompaniment. 
Ingredients:
4 beetroot, trimmed 400g Brussels sprouts, halved 400g turnips, peeled & cut into wedges 2cm thick 3 tbsp butter 1 small red onion, finely chopped 50g hazelnuts, finely chopped 2 tsp fresh thyme, chopped 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp Muscat vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Put the beetroot in a dish, add a splash of water, then cover with foil and bake until tender – about 45 minutes, depending on size. Meanwhile, add the sprouts to a large pan of boiling salted water and cook for about 5 minutes, until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon, refresh in cold water, then drain and set aside. In the same water, cook the turnips for about 6 minutes, until just tender, then drain and refresh in cold water. Drain again and set aside. Melt the butter in a large frying pan, add the onion and hazelnuts and fry for about 3 minutes, until the nuts start to brown. Add the thyme and garlic and mix well. Add the beetroot, sprouts and turnips and cover the pan. Cook gently for about 5 minutes to heat the vegetables through. Sprinkle with the vinegar, season to taste and mix well.
