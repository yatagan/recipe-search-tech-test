Creamed corn
Introduction:
A delicious accompaniment to barbecued meats. 
Ingredients:
2 large sweetcorn cobs 25g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 4 tbsp double cream leaves from 3 fresh thyme sprigs ½ tsp paprika salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the papery husks and any stringy bits from the cobs. Stand on their ends and cut off the kernels. Melt the butter and oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently for about 8 minutes. Add the corn kernels, cream, thyme and paprika. Season and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. For a creamier texture, purée a little of the mixture and stir back in.
