Puntarelle alla romana
Introduction:
The classic Italian way to serve puntarelle. If you’re vegetarian, or don’t want to use anchovies, use a few chopped capers with a pinch of salt to mimic the salty anchovy flavour. Although not traditional, the salad is also good with a little grated parmesan, or with some of the outer leaves added too. To prepare the inner buds for the traditional Italian dish puntarelle alla romana, after removing the outer leaves, break off the hollow-stemmed buds. Very finely slice the buds, lengthways. Soak in iced water for 1-2 hours to let them crisp and curl. Spin or pat dry with kitchen paper. 
Ingredients:
2-3 salted anchovy fillets, finely chopped 1 tbsp red or white wine vinegar, or use lemon juice 1 small garlic clove, finely chopped or crushed pinch of chilli flakes (optional) 2-3 tbsp olive oil 1 puntarelle, inner buds prepared as above pepper
Method:
In a bowl, mix the anchovies, vinegar or lemon juice, garlic, a pinch of pepper and the chilli flakes if using. Add 2-3 tbsp olive oil, depending how sharp you like your dressing. Toss with the prepared punterelle buds.
