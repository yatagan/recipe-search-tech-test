Lamb, beetroot and rocket salad with pumpkin seed and chilli dressing
Introduction:
This is a truly sumptuous salad: succulent slices of griddled lamb set off by earthy beets and sweet blood oranges. With a bit of crunch from the pumpkin seeds and the freshness of the herbs and rocket, a very good dinner is complete. 
Ingredients:
4 lamb steaks 500g beetroot, whole, with their skins on 100g rocket leaves 2 blood oranges, peeled & cut into half moon shapes or segments for the dressing: 50g pumpkin seeds, toasted 1 red chilli, deseeded & chopped (or use crumbled dried chilli) 1 garlic clove, crushed juice of 1 lemon handful of fresh parsley, roughly chopped handful of fresh mint, roughly chopped 150ml olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
For the dressing put all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz to a paste. Spread half the mixture over the lamb steaks and leave to marinate. While the lamb is marinating, cook the beetroot: Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cover each whole beetroot with foil and bake in the oven until tender, about 1-1½ hours, depending on their size. Remove from the oven and rub off the skin when cool enough to handle, then cut into wedges. Heat a griddle pan and cook the lamb for about 4-5 minutes on each sides, depending on the thickness of the meat. Leave to rest, then slice thickly. Arrange the rocket, beetroot and oranges on a plate. Scatter over the lamb pieces and drizzle over a little more of the dressing to serve.
