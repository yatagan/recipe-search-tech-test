Fennel salad
Introduction:
As a rough guide, one fennel bulb should be enough to feed three to four people. As a first course this salad goes very well with good bread and thinly sliced salted beef or cured ham. It's clean crunch also makes a nice side to a steak or a meaty fillet of fish. 
Ingredients:
1 fennel bulb lemon juice olive oil fresh parsley to garnish & fennel fronds if available, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Trim the fennel, removing tough stalks and base but reserving the green feathery fronds. Quarter, then slice each quarter very, very thinly. Arrange the slices in a serving dish, squeeze over lemon juice, then a generous drizzle of olive oil. Season. Chop the reserved fronds roughly and scatter over the top, along with a little chopped parsley.
