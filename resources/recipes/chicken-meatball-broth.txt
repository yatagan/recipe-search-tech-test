Chicken meatball broth
Introduction:
It doesn’t leave you feeling bloated so is a good standby for summer months. In the UK, harissa paste is almost invariably red hot. I’m not an authority, but a more herby, less fiery version is much more useful in the kitchen. You can make this by mixing a tablespoon of bought paste with half a teaspoon each of lightly toasted cumin and caraway seeds and dried mint and a tablespoon each of fresh coriander and Italian parsley. Grind up the spices in a mortar and pestle and mix in everything else.
Ingredients:
for the meatballs: 1 chicken breast fillet, very finely chopped or minced 1 tbsp ground almonds 1 tbsp parsley, chopped 1 egg, beaten 3 tbsp breadcrumbs ¼ tsp dried mint 1 spring onion, finely chopped for the broth: 1¼ litres clear chicken stock 1 heaped tsp harissa paste, more if you like zest & juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper chopped fresh herbs, e.g. flat leaf parsley, chives, coriander or mint, to serve
Method:
Make the meatballs by mixing all the ingredients and forming it into very small balls. Make the broth: Heat the stock, stir in the harissa paste and add the lemon zest and juice. Simmer for 10 minutes, add the meatballs and cook gently for another 10 minutes. Garnish with chopped herbs of your choice.
