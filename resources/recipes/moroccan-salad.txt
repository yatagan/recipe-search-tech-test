Moroccan salad
Introduction:
An easy, seasonal salad and a popular side dish in Morocco and Tunisia. This goes well with couscous and grilled meats. Another good way to eat it is as a starter with black olives and quartered boiled eggs. Minced preserved lemon is a very good addition, as is a little crumbled goat's cheese. 
Ingredients:
2 large green peppers, quartered & deseeded 450g ripe tomatoes, deseeded & chopped 1 tbsp lemon juice 3 tbsp olive oil 1 large garlic clove, crushed Â½ tsp ground cumin 2 tbsp fresh parsley or coriander, finely chopped
Method:
Grill the peppers skin-side to heat until blackened and blistered. Drop into a plastic bag, knot the ends and leave until cool enough to handle. Strip off the skin, then cut the peppers into small pieces. Mix with the tomatoes and any juice given out by the peppers. To make the dressing mix the remaining ingredients. Toss with the tomatoes and peppers. Serve at room temperature.
