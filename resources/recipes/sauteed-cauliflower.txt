Sautéed cauliflower
Introduction:
Cauliflower is endlessly adaptable. This quick recipe is salty and rich with a little bit of crunch. It brings out cauliflower's deep, sweet nuttiness. It goes very well with grilled fish or chicken, or stirred through pasta. 
Ingredients:
1 large cauliflower (or half cauliflower & half purple sprouting broccoli) 4 tbsp olive oil 100g fresh breadcrumbs 3 anchovy fillets, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Separate cauliflower into reasonably large florets. Heat oil in a deep saucepan (with a lid) and add cauliflower. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove lid and sprinkle the crumbs over the cauliflower. Cook uncovered over a moderate heat until cauliflower is tender and the breadcrumbs have browned - stirring from time to time for a further 5 minutes. Put anchovies and garlic into a small bowl over boiling water until the anchovies ‘melt’. Stir in parsley and olive oil. Transfer cauliflower and crumb mixture into a serving dish. Spoon over anchovy oil and grind in pepper. Serve hot or warm.
