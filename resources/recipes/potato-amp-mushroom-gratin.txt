Potato and mushroom gratin
Introduction:
This vegetarian gratin is a good simple supper with a green salad. For added depth of flavour, use a range of different mushrooms, including wild or dried porcini soaked for 5 minutes in cold water. You could also add some grated cheese for the last minutes of cooking – Pecorino and Gruyère are both good. 
Ingredients:
20g butter 750g potatoes, sliced into coins about 3-4mm thick 400g mushrooms, wiped & sliced 200ml stock, cream or milk, or a mixture of these
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Butter a gratin dish, then cover with a layer of potatoes and a layer of mushrooms. Continue with these alternate layers, dotting with more butter and adding seasoning as you go, until you are out of mushrooms and potatoes. Pour over the liquid and cook for about 1 hour, covered with foil. Remove the foil and cook for another 20-30 minutes, until browned on top.
