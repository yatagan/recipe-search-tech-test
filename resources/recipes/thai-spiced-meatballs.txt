Thai spiced meatballs
Introduction:
Often ignored in favour of beef, pork mince is a far better vehicle for many seasonings â€“ particularly Thai and Chinese spices. This recipe calls for the meat to be marinated overnight in the fridge. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp fish sauce 3 lemongrass stalks 2 garlic cloves, grated 1 thumb fresh ginger, grated 4 tbsp coriander, chopped pinch salt 350g minced pork 1 egg white, lightly beaten 1 litre chicken or vegetable stock 4 tbsp soya sauce
Method:
Add the fish sauce, lemongrass stalks (bashed with a rolling pin), garlic, ginger, coriander and a good pinch of salt to the mince. Mix the whole lot together and leave overnight. The next day pick out the strands of lemongrass and stir in the egg white. Form the mixture into small meatballs and poach them in stock for about 8 minutes. Drain off the stock, reserving 4 tablespoons to mix with the soya sauce. Serve as a sauce over the meatballs with plain rice or noodles.
