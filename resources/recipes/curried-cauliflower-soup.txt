Curried cauliflower soup
Introduction:
This quick vegetarian recipe, kindly donated by a box scheme customer, is full flavoured and creamy without including any actual cream. The mild nuttiness of the cauliflower blends beautifully with the aromatic heat of the curry spices. A very warming lunch or dinner with a hunk of crusty bread. 
Ingredients:
2 medium onions, chopped 3 garlic cloves, chopped (or more, if you like) 2 tsp medium curry powder 2 tsp hot curry powder (but you could use all mild if you prefer) 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground cumin 1 large cauliflower broken into florets 2 medium carrots, chopped 1 potato, peeled & diced 1.1 litre chicken stock plain fat-free yoghurt salt & pepper
Method:
Sauté onion & garlic in a little oil until translucent, stirring often for about 5 minutes in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add spices; stir for 1 minute. Add cauliflower, carrots and potatoes; stir 1 minute. Add stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Purée soup in blender, or use a stick blender in the pot - no mess. Return soup to same pot and bring to simmer. Season. Ladle soup into bowls and top with a teaspoon of plain fat-free yoghurt.
