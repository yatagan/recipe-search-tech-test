Leek and lemon fettuccine
Introduction:
If you're in the mood for a light, fresh dinner, this quick dish is excellent. Leeks go particularly well with long flat pasta like fettucine or tagliatelle, but use whatever pasta you'd like. Substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese if you are vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
400g fettuccine or any other pasta 3 tbsp olive oil 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp fresh oregano leaves 3 large leeks, finely sliced grated zest of 1 lemon 1 tbsp small capers 70g Parmesan grated, & some more to serve 30g flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped 2 tbsp crème fraîche (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil for the pasta. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the garlic, oregano and leeks. Sauté until the leeks are soft and transparent, then season. Cook the pasta until it is al dente, then drain and return it to the warm pan. Add the leeks, grated lemon zest, capers, Parmesan and parsley, stirring them into the pasta. Finish with crème fraîche, if using. Season, and serve with more Parmesan.
