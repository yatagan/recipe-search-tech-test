Pumpkin (or squash) pancakes
Introduction:
This is a twist on the traditional version of a Scotch (or American) pancake, incorporating pumpkin flesh for added moistness and sweetness. Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a couple of tea towels until they're all reading to serve. 
Ingredients:
150g pumpkin, peeled & diced 120g self-raising flour 30g caster sugar (about 2 tbsp) ½ tsp cream of tartar ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda ½ tsp mixed spice ½ tsp salt 2 eggs about 2 tbsp milk oil for greasing, e.g. sunflower maple syrup or honey, to serve
Method:
Steam or boil the pumpkin until soft (about 10 minutes). Purée in a food processor (or mash really well) and leave to cool. Mix the flour, sugar, cream of tartar, bicarbonate of soda, mixed spice and salt together in a large bowl. Add the eggs and cooled pumpkin purée. Whisk together, then gradually add enough milk (about 2 tablespoons) until the mixture has the consistency of double cream. Heat a large non-stick frying pan or flat griddle pan. Add a little oil and use a piece of kitchen paper to grease the pan all over. Add a large tablespoon of the pancake mixture and repeat; you’ll probably have room for about four at a time. Fry on a low to medium heat, until you see bubbles forming all over the top of the pancake. Gently use a pallet knife to turn the pancakes (they should be a golden brown colour), then cook for a minute or so, until golden brown on the other side. Cook in batches and keep warm, wrapped in a clean tea towel. Serve drizzled with maple syrup, or honey.
