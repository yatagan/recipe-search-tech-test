Pork chops with sage and onion gravy
Introduction:
'It is such a doddle to make a good gravy with pork, would that it were as easy with other meats and poultry. Add onions and sage and there is really no need to use stock or bouillon. Make some creamy mashed potatoes, cook up your favourite vegetables and enjoy all with lashings of this delicious sauce.' (Ben Watson) 
Ingredients:
20g butter 2 medium onions, sliced 16-20 fresh sage leaves, torn 4 pork chops 1 tbsp crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Heat a large frying pan, add the butter to melt then throw in the onions and sage. Fry off until turning golden and wilting but not burning. Season the pork chops, push the onion to one side of the pan and squeeze in the pork chops, heaping the onion and sage over them. Fry for 10 minutes each side or until cooked through completely, lift out to a warm dish. Add a little water to the pan and scrape meat juices into the sauce, add crème fraîche and adjust seasoning, serve over the chops.
