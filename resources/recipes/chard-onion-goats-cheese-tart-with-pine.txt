Chard, onion and goat's cheese tart with pine nuts and currants
Introduction:
A simple base of chard and goat's cheese topped with a rich combination of currants and pine nuts. This is a tart that's good for lunch, a dinner starter or a picnic. You can make the onion and chard mix and pre-bake the tart base in advance, then do the final bake just 15 minutes before you are ready to eat. 
Ingredients:
3 onions, finely sliced 3 tbsp olive oil & a trickle more 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 300-600g chard ½ tsp ground nutmeg juice of ½ lemon 400g shortcrust pastry 200g soft goat's cheese, crumbled handful pine nuts, gently dry fried until golden handful currants or raisins, soaked in warm water for 20 mins & drained salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 7. Sweat the onions in the olive oil over a lowish heat until golden, about 20-25 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for a few minutes more. Chop the chard stalks finely (discard any that are really big and stringy) and the leaves roughly. Blanch the chard in 2cm water in a covered saucepan until the stalks are just tender and the leaves wilted. Rinse under cold water and squeeze out. Combine with the onion and garlic mix and season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and a squeeze of lemon. Roll out pastry to a thickness of about 2mm, either in a single rough rectangle or 4 individual tart bases (rectangles or circles). Lay on a lightly oiled and floured baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes in the middle of the oven. You can do everything up to this point several hours in advance. Reduce or preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Spread the chard and onion mix over the pastry base, leaving a border of 1-2cm clear round the edge. Scatter over the goat's cheese, pine nuts and currants and a final trickle of olive oil. Return to the oven for 10-15 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and the cheese is starting to brown.
