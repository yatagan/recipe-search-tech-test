Leek and cream risotto
Introduction:
This comforting vegetarian risotto can be eaten as a weeknight main or as a luxurious side. Use winter leeks if you can for this recipe as their stronger taste sings out better from the risotto. This is also good with an added handful of frozen peas or fried mushrooms – or perhaps some salty bacon. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 4 leeks, white parts only, thinly sliced 1½ litre vegetable stock 350g risotto rice 175ml single cream Parmesan, grated, to serve
Method:
Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water and simmer for 20 minutes, adding more water if necessary. Meanwhile bring the stock to the boil in another pan. Stir the rice into the leeks. Add a ladleful of the hot stock and cook, stirring, until it has been absorbed. Continue adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stirring until each addition has been absorbed. This will take about 20 minutes. When the rice is tender, stir in the cream and season to taste. Serve with Parmesan.
