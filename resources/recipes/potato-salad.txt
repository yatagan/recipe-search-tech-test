Potato salad
Introduction:
A lovely, traditional, warm-weather salad. The creaminess is cut through by the sharpness of capers, gherkins and mustard vinaigrette. If you have them to hand, try adding chopped parsley, spring onions, red onions or chives. This recipe makes a very good picnic component, or a summer lunch. 
Ingredients:
1kg new potatoes, scrubbed 100ml white wine vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil 5 eggs, hardboiled, shelled & chopped 150ml Greek-style yoghurt 150ml mayonnaise 150ml crème fraîche 2-3 tbsp chopped gherkins 1 tbsp capers, soaked in cold water for 20 mins, then squeezed dry & chopped 1 tbsp English mustard 1 tbsp wholegrain mustard 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until tender, then drain. While they are still hot, cut them into quarters and mix with the vinegar, oil and some salt and pepper. Mix all the remaining ingredients together in a bowl. Add the potatoes, mix well and adjust the seasoning.
