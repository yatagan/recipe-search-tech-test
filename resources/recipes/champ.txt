Introduction:
This inexpensive dish (also called poundies) goes well with sausages or pork chops. Traditionally it's made with floury potatoes, though waxier varieties would work just fine. Don't beat them too much if using waxy potatoes – you'll risk them turning gluey. Beating mash made with floury potatoes should give a light, fluffy result. 
Ingredients:
1kg floury potatoes, such as Cosmos, Sante, Cara or Maris Piper, peeled & cut into chunks 100ml milk 100ml double cream bunch of spring onions, chopped butter, diced salt & pepper
Method:
Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until tender. Drain well in a colander and leave for a few minutes for excess water to drain off. Heat the milk and cream in a large pan. Add the spring onions and heat through. Pass the potatoes through a mouli-légumes or a potato ricer into the hot cream and spring onions and then beat well. Serve topped with lots of diced butter; it will melt into the potato. Season to taste.
