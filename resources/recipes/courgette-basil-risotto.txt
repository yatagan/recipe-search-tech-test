Courgette and basil risotto
Introduction:
This courgette and basil risotto is an easy, cheap and delectable meal – good with a green salad or on its own. All that's required for success is some dedicated stirring. Substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese if you are vegetarian. Toasted pine nuts make a very nice garnish here along with the basil and parsley. This recipe also welcomes the addition of other light summer veg – asparagus, broad bean or peas. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 3 large courgettes, cut into 2cm dice 50g butter 1 onion, finely chopped 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 200g risotto rice handful basil leaves, shredded 200ml white wine 1 litre chicken stock handful parsley leaves, chopped 50g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy-based pan. Fry the courgettes on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes to soften and slightly colour, then remove to a plate. Heat half the butter in the same pan. Fry the onion very gently for 8 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and rice and stir for 2 minutes. Season. Shred in half the basil. Add the wine and let it bubble until almost all absorbed. Gradually add ladles of hot stock, letting each absorb before adding the next, stirring often. The rice will take about 25-30 minutes; it should be tender but still with a little bite. When it’s ready, stir in the courgettes, half the cheese, the rest of the butter, parsley and basil. Leave to stand off the heat for 2 minutes, then stir gently. Check the seasoning, then serve sprinkled with the rest of the cheese.
