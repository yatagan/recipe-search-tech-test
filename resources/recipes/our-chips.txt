Our chips
Introduction:
Chip Day at the staff canteen causes a stampede at lunchtime. The secret to making them work is a good floury potato, such as Maris Piper or Cosmos. It's easiest to make chips in a thermostatically controlled deep-fat fryer, which maintains the temperature of the oil. You still get good results using a large, deep pan, but make sure you don't fill it more than a third full with oil; the level can rise alarmingly when you add the potatoes. Eat with ketchup, vinegar, spring onion mayonnaise or whatever else you fancy.
Ingredients:
large potatoes (we tend to use Cosmos baking potatoes but any decent floury or baking variety will do), peeled & very thickly sliced sunflower oil for deep-frying
Method:
Rinse the chips under cold water for a few minutes, then drain them well, spread out on a tea towel and pat dry. Heat some sunflower oil to 140°C in a deep-fat fryer or a deep saucepan. Cook the chips in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, for about 5-6 minutes, until they are soft all the way through but not browned. Remove each batch and drain on kitchen paper when they are done. This first frying can be done well in advance and the chips finished off just before serving. When ready to serve, heat the oil to 190°C and plunge in the chips to brown, again cooking them in batches. They will only take 2-3 minutes this time. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with salt and serve immediately.
