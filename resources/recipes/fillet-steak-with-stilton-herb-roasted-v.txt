Fillet steak with Stilton and herb roasted veg
Introduction:
Herb-infused roasted veg, tender fillet steak and a luxurious piquant cheese sauce make for the best sort of dinner. If anything more is needed it's a few lightly steamed green beans or a crisp salad. 
Ingredients:
500g mixed vegetables (choose from potatoes, beetroot, carrots, celeriac, squash, parsnips, red onions, swede) 2 garlic cloves olive oil for drizzling 1 tsp thyme leaves or chopped rosemary 100g Cropwell Bishop Stilton, crumbled 2 tbsp cream or crème fraîche 1 tsp Dijon mustard pinch of ground cayenne or paprika small squeeze lemon juice 2 fillet steaks oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Peel the veg and cut into 3cm chunks (if using beetroot and carrot, cut them slightly smaller, as they take longer to cook; if using onions, cut into quarters, leaving the root on to hold them together; leave shallots whole). Parboil the potatoes for 2 minutes, then drain. Put all the veg in a roasting tray, add the garlic and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with thyme or rosemary and season. Roast in the oven for about 45 minutes, turning halfway through, until tender and browned. For the sauce: Put ¾ of the Stilton, cream or crème fraîche, mustard, cayenne or paprika in a saucepan. Season with pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Heat gently, stirring until the cheese has melted. Keep warm. Season the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a little oil in a heavy based frying pan and when the oil is very hot, add the steaks. Fry for about 2 minutes on either side (depending on thickness of steak) for medium rare steak. Remove from the pan. Leave to rest for a few minutes before serving. Spoon the sauce over the steak with the rest of the cheese on top. Serve with the roasted veg.
