Garlic and onion purée
Introduction:
This is an easy-to-make purée that can be stirred into soups, stews and casseroles to add a good punch of flavour. Or try it as a sauce with roast meat or grilled fish. 
Ingredients:
3 heads garlic 350g onions, roughly chopped 8 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Separate the cloves of garlic, but do not peel. Place in a heavy-based pan with the onion and olive oil. Cover and stew very gently over a low heat until both garlic and onion are meltingly tender - a good 40 minutes or so. Let the mixture cool slightly. Using your hands, squeeze the cooked garlic out of its skins, back into the pan. Liquidize the onions and garlic together, sieve and season. Re-heat when ready to serve.
