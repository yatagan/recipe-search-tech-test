Purple sprouting broccoli with rosemary roasted tomato and anchovy dressing
Introduction:
Broccoli and anchovies are a natural pairing and rosemary-roasted tomatoes add aromatic intensity to this veggie side. You can either eat your broccoli crunchy by blanching it very briefly or, if you prefer, cook it slightly longer for a yielding tenderness. Use purple sprouting when it's in season. This goes well with salmon or with lamb chops. 
Ingredients:
250g cherry tomatoes, halved crossways 3 garlic cloves leaves of 2 sprigs rosemary, very finely chopped 1 tsp caster sugar olive oil 6 anchovy fillets 400g purple sprouting broccoli
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Place the tomatoes, cut side up, on a non-stick baking tray. Tuck in the garlic and sprinkle over the rosemary and sugar. Drizzle with plenty of olive oil. Roast on a low shelf for 1 hour, until the tomatoes are sticky and starting to caramelise. Keep an eye out so they don’t burn. Gently warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan. Add the anchovies and stir until they melt. Add the tomatoes and all the sticky juices from the roasting pan to the anchovies. Lightly mash with a fork. Season to taste. Steam or boil the purple sprouting broccoli for 3 minutes, until just tender. Toss with the tomato dressing to serve.
