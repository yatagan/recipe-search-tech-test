Red cabbage coleslaw with yoghurt dressing
Introduction:
A really fresh salad. Good for a winter lunch, along with a bowl of soup and some warm bread. The colours are beautiful – although to really appreciate them you should try the salad with a plain vinaigrette rather than the garlic yoghurt dressing. Make sure that the cabbage is very finely shredded or this'll be a bit too crunchy. White cabbage is an option but will be less spectacular. 
Ingredients:
150ml yoghurt, preferably goat's milk 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice 1 garlic clove, crushed ½ red cabbage, very finely shredded 2 carrots, grated or shredded 1 small onion, grated 2-3 apples, grated & tossed in lemon juice to prevent browning handful fresh coriander leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Combine yoghurt, olive oil, vinegar and garlic clove, mix well. Combine the remaining ingredients and mix in the dressing. You can reserve a few coriander leaves for garnish if you wish. Some toasted pumpkin seeds also make a nice addition.
