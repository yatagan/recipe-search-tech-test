Spiced plum and star anise jelly
Introduction:
One of the best thing about plum jelly is that sets quickly and reliably. This goes well with scones, baguette or toast, mixed into yoghurt for breakfast, or as an accompaniment to tangy goat's cheese. Makes 1-1¼kg. 
Ingredients:
1.5kg plums, washed, left whole 10 whole star anise granulated sugar knob of butter
Method:
Put the plums in a preserving pan with 900ml cold water. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, breaking them down now and then with a wooden spoon. When completely soft, ladle into a jelly bag (scald with boiling water to sterilise), suspended on a stand over a bowl. Leave to drip overnight - avoid pressing the pulp down or the jelly will be cloudy. Measure the liquid in the bowl. The easiest way is in old money: 1 pint liquid needs 1lb sugar (or 600ml liquid to 450g sugar). Put several saucers in the fridge to chill. Put the liquid in the preserving pan with the star anise. Add the correct amount of sugar. Heat very gently to melt the crystals - it will take a while. Boil rapidly for 15 minutes. Test by spooning 1 teaspoon onto a cold saucer. Wait for 1 minute, then push the liquid with your spoon. If it wrinkles, it’s ready - turn off the heat. If not, boil and test every 5 minutes until it does. Add a small knob of butter and leave for 5 minutes. Skim off any scum. Pot into sterilised jars, adding one star anise to each.
