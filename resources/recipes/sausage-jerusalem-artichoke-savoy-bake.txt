Sausage, Jerusalem artichoke and Savoy bake
Introduction:
This simple recipe just requires you to add each of the ingredients to the roasting tin at the right time: first sausages, then Jerusalem artichokes and lentils, and finally the cabbage. Fragrantly seasoned with thyme, fennel seeds, chilli and lemon, nothing more is needed for a satisfying dinner. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. rapeseed 8 sausages 1 litre hot chicken or light beef stock (you may not need it all) 600g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed & cut into half or wedges 80g Puy lentils, rinsed & drained leaves from 4 large thyme sprigs 1 tsp fennel seeds ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes zest of ½ a lemon, finely grated 1 Savoy cabbage, outer leaves removed, cut into wedges with the root intact fresh parsley leaves, to garnish (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a flame and ovenproof roasting tin (or use a frying pan and transfer to a tin). Fry the sausages until brown on all sides. Add 800ml stock. Remove from the heat, cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover. Add the Jerusalem artichokes, lentils, thyme, fennel seeds, chilli, lemon zest and season with salt and pepper. Cook in the oven for 15 minutes or so, uncovered, then wedge the cabbage between the other things in the tray and spoon over a little more stock. Cook for another 10-15 minutes, until everything is tender. Sprinkle over the parsley to serve, if using.
