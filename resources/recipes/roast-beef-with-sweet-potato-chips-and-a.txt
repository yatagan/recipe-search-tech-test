Roast beef with sweet potato chips and aioli
Introduction:
This sumptuous meal in one baking tray is a good, easy beef dinner. You could also try other root veg in place of the sweet potato – parsnips, carrots and beets would all go well. 
Ingredients:
1kg boneless sirloin 1 tbsp grain mustard olive oil 800g sweet potatoes, peeled 1 sprig thyme 2 garlic cloves 4 tbsp mayonnaise 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 230°C/Gas 8. Rub the beef with grain mustard and drizzle over a little olive oil, season and transfer to the very hot oven. After 20 minutes lower the temperature to 190°C/Gas 5 for the rest of the cooking time - see note. Cut the sweet potato into thick cut chips and surround the roast with them for the final 45 minutes of cooking - turning to coat with beef fat and seasoned with salt, pepper and a few thyme leaves, turning once more during cooking time. Rest the meat for 10 minutes before carving. Make aioli by crushing the garlic with some salt, squash to a creamy pulp and mix with the mayonnaise and parsley to serve with beef and chips.
