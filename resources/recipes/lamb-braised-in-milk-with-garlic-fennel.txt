Lamb braised in milk with garlic & fennel
Introduction:
This recipe is rather luxurious, it hails from New York's, Italian chef, Mario Batali. 
Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste 2 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley 1 heaped tsp fennel seeds 2 tbsp olive oil 650g boneless lamb leg, in 4cm cubes 600ml milk 150ml double cream or crème fraîche 2 rosemary sprigs
Method:
Mix the garlic with the flat leaf parsley and fennel seeds to form a coarse paste. In a large, heavy casserole, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic paste and cook over moderate heat for about 1 minute. Increase the heat and add the lamb pieces. Cook, turning, until lightly browned all over. Transfer the lamb to a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add 150ml of the milk to the casserole and cook over a high heat for 2 minutes, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Add the remaining 450ml of milk, the cream, rosemary and the seared lamb and its juices. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lamb is tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the lamb to a bowl; discard the rosemary. Boil the milk mixture over high heat until reduced by nearly half. Purée the hot milk mixture in a blender. Return the sauce to the casserole, add the lamb and simmer over low heat until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
