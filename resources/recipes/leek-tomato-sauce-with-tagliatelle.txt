Leek and tomato sauce with tagliatelle
Introduction:
This straightforward vegetarian pasta sauce goes especially well with tagliatelle. It requires little effort to make and is a good weeknight supper. The sauce can also be served over grains, white beans and fish. Try adding some chilli flakes or fennel seeds when frying the leeks for a spicier variation. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 4-5 leeks, white & pale green parts only, finely sliced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 large sprig of rosemary 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes small handful of parsley, finely chopped 400g tagliatelle or other pasta Parmesan cheese, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan and gently cook the leeks, garlic and rosemary together for 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, season, cover the pan and simmer for a further 20 minutes. Once cooked, fish out the rosemary stalk and stir through half the chopped parsley. Meanwhile, cook the pasta. Drain, mix the remaining oil into the pasta and then pour over the sauce. Garnish each plate with the remaining chopped parsley and serve with Parmesan.
