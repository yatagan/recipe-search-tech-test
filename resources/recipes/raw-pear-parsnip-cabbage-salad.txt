Pear, parsnip & red cabbage slaw
Introduction:
A selection of raw winter veg. Treat it as a slaw over the festive period, serve it as a salad alongside cold cuts, or extend into a quick lunch by adding some cooked lentils and toasted nuts to the mix. If you put it anywhere near roast beef, then consider adding a dab of horseradish. 
Ingredients:
¼ red cabbage, very finely shredded Handful of radicchio or chicory leaves, roughly torn 1 beetroot, peeled and cut into fine matchsticks 2 tbsp red wine vinegar ½ tbsp Dijon mustard salt and pepper 1 pear, finely sliced or peeled 1 parsnip, cut into fine matchsticks ½ red onion, finely sliced 1 tsp poppy seeds pinch of allspice 2 tbsp olive oil Small bunch of parsley, roughly chopped
Method:
Prepare the cabbage, radicchio and beetroot. Mix them together in a large bowl with the vinegar, mustard and a good pinch of salt. Leave for 10 mins while you prepare everything else. Add everything else and mix thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
