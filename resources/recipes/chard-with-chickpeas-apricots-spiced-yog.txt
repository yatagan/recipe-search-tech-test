Chard with chickpeas, apricots and spiced yoghurt
Introduction:
This quick, complex-tasting side is good with lamb or as a light vegetarian main eaten with toasted pitta. 
Ingredients:
½ tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp coriander seeds 150g plain yoghurt squeeze lemon juice, to taste 300g chard 2 tbsp olive oil 60g dried apricots, roughly chopped 40g shelled pistachio nuts, toasted & roughly chopped 200g tinned cooked chickpeas, drained & rinsed large handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a dry frying pan, lightly toast the cumin and coriander seeds for 1-2 minutes. Grind in a pestle and mortar (or use a rolling pin and bowl). Mix with the yoghurt and add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Leave to one side. Cut out the white stalks from the chard leaves and roughly chop the leaves. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, add the chard, season and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the apricots, pistachio nuts and chickpeas and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the chard is just wilted. Add the parsley, stir to combine and add a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with the yoghurt.
