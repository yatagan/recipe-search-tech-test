Easy ideas for sweetcorn
Introduction:
Eaten either on the cob or off it, sweetcorn is quick and simple to prepare. Eat it as quickly as possible when you get it in your box, before the sweet sugars start turning into starch. It goes well with chilli, lime, lemon, squash, peppers, crab, coriander, chives, thyme. 
Ingredients:
Sweetcorn on the cob
Method:
Boil or steam for 4-10 minutes (very fresh cobs take less time to cook). Toss in a little butter with freshly ground black pepper. Stir fry 4cm pieces in a little oil for a few minutes. Braise with greens: cut the kernels from 2 cobs and cook gently in a pan with a knob of butter, stirring now and then, for about 8 minutes. Add a crushed garlic clove and cook for another couple of minutes until the corn is tender and lightly browned. Add 300g chopped chard or spinach. Cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season and serve. Add a chopped fresh chilli along with the garlic to spice it up if you like.
