Gooseberry, pear and elderflower crumble
Introduction:
This seasonal crumble can also be made with apples instead of pears. Taste your gooseberries before adding the sugar; if they're not too sharp use less sugar. Homemade elderflower cordial would be good if you've got a bottle, but shop bought is fine to use too. Serve with some lightly whipped cream with the addition of a little extra cordial to taste. To make this gluten-free, substitute the flour and oats for gluten-free varieties. 
Ingredients:
300g gooseberries, topped & tailed 4 pears, cut into bite sized pieces 175g caster sugar 3 tbsp elderflower cordial 125g unsalted butter 165g plain flour 150g rolled oats 25g soft light brown sugar
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Put the gooseberries and pears in a baking or gratin dish (20-25cm in size) and evenly sprinkle in the caster sugar and add the elderflower cordial. To make the topping, use your fingertips to lightly rub the butter and flour together in a large bowl, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the oats and sugar and mix gently to combine. Alternatively if you are short of time, blitz all the topping ingredients in a food processor until they just start to come together. Spread the crumble topping over the fruit. Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, until the topping is golden.
