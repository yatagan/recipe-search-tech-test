Turkey saltimbocca
Introduction:
This is a turkey-based variation of a traditional Italian dish of veal cooked with prosciutto and sage. An indicator of how good it is is that its name translates as ‘jump in the mouth’. The lean turkey meat works well here in place of veal, with the fat from the prosciutto keeping everything moist. 
Ingredients:
1 boneless turkey joint 4 slices prosciutto 8 fresh sage leaves generous knob of unsalted butter 125ml white wine Parmesan, grated (to serve) salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the turkey joint into four and gently tap out with a rolling pin until the escalopes are an even thickness of about 3mm. Season well, place a slice of prosciutto and a couple of sage leaves on each escalope, then roll up and secure with a cocktail stick. Cook gently in butter in a heavy-based frying pan until evenly brown, turning regularly. Pour the white wine over the meat, cover the pan and allow to cook gently for another 10 minutes. Serve with a grating of Parmesan, mash and seasonal greens.
