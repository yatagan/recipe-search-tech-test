Celeriac and potato mash
Introduction:
Adding celeriac adds a deep, earthy backbone to the potato so that it pairs well with strong flavours â€“ venison or lamb, or any kind of rich stew. This is also a great, tactful way to persuade children to love this monstrously ugly vegetable. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & cut into chunks 500g celeriac, peeled & cut into chunks 100ml milk 100g butter 100ml double cream (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Put the potatoes in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Add the celeriac and cook until both are just tender. Mash together, add the milk, butter and cream if using. Season well with salt and pepper.
