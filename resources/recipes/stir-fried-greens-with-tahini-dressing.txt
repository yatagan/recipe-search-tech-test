Stir-fried greens with tahini dressing
Introduction:
The list of dressing ingredients looks long but the sauce is easy to make, goes well with salads and cooked vegetables, and keeps for weeks in the fridge. 
Ingredients:
4-6 heads spring or summer greens depending on size, washed & trimmed oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower for the dressing: 3 tbsp tahini (sesame paste) 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 3 tbsp water 2 tbsp rice or cider vinegar 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil 1 ½ tsp sugar 2 tsp lemon juice ½ tsp wasabi paste (Japanese horseradish) or English mustard 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tsp ginger, finely grated salt & pepper
Method:
Make the dressing by combining the tahini, oil, water, vinegar and soy and mixing well until you have a smooth cream. Then add the remaining ingredients, again mixing well. Finely shred the greens. Heat the oil over a high heat in a large heavy bottomed pan, and add the greens. Cook for a couple of minutes until the greens are bright and just tender. Season and put on a serving plate. Spoon over the dressing and serve.
