Sausage and mushroom cassoulet
Introduction:
This is a quick version of a casserole with no long oven-cooking required. It's easy, cheap and hearty and makes a good one-pot dinner for feeding a family. You can use any other white beans instead of haricots. Serve with some braised or steamed greens and boiled or mashed potatoes. 
Ingredients:
450g sausages 4 tbsp sunflower oil 1 large onion, thickly sliced 2-3 garlic cloves, chopped 200g mushrooms, cleaned & halved 1 tsp plain flour 1 bay leaf 2 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary 125ml red wine 125ml stock (or use more wine) 1 tsp tomato purée 400g tin haricot beans, drained & rinsed salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Prick the sausages, place in a baking dish and toss in 1 tablespoon of oil. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the oven and when just cool enough to handle, chop in half or pieces. Meanwhile heat the rest of the oil in a large frying pan. Gently cook the onions for 10 minutes until soft and just coloured Add the garlic and mushrooms and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the bay leaf, thyme or rosemary, red wine (plus stock if using) and tomato purée. Heat until bubbling, add the haricot beans, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add a splash more stock or water if the liquid is too thick, or simmer for a bit longer to thicken. Add the sausages. Season to taste and serve.
