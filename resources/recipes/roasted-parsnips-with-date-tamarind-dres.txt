Roasted parsnips with date and tamarind dressing
Introduction:
Tamarind is a bit like a date in flavour, only with a much tarter finish. Combined with spices, dates, chilli, ginger and lime it make tangy, sharp sauce that works beautifully with the caramelised sweetness of roasted parsnips. You could also try this sauce with an array of roasted root veg – carrots, beetroot, swede and sweet potato would all be good. 
Ingredients:
500g parsnips, peeled & cut in half if small or chunks if larger olive oil 1 tbsp tamarind paste ½ tsp fennel seeds ½ tsp coriander seeds 50g pitted dates, finely chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped ½ tsp fresh ginger, grated 1 lime salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Put the parsnips in a baking dish and toss in just enough oil to coat. Season well. Roast for 45 minutes-1 hour, until tender and browned (caramelised bits are a good thing with parsnips). Put the tamarind paste in a small heatproof bowl. Pour over 2 tablespoons of boiling water and leave for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put the fennel and coriander seeds in a small dry pan. Heat gently for a minute or two, until you can just smell them, then grind in a pestle and mortar. Sieve the tamarind mixture and put the drained liquid in a small saucepan. Add the ground seeds, dates, chilli, ginger and 250ml water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and bubble for 10 minutes. Blitz in a blender until smooth. Squeeze some lime juice over the parsnips, then drizzle with the dressing. You can keep any leftover dressing in the fridge or freeze it.
