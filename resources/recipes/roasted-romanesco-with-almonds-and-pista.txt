Roasted Romanesco with almonds and pistachios
Introduction:
Beautiful, fractal romanesco tossed with toasted almonds and pistachios, fresh herbs, lemon juice and bulgur. This elegant, healthy vegan-friendly main is a good, quick weeknight dinner. Garnish with jewel-like pomegranate seeds if you can find them for added crunch and sweetness. 
Ingredients:
200g bulghur wheat 2 small or 1 very large Romanesco olive oil 100g flaked almonds 100g shelled pistachios large bunch fresh parsley, leaves finely chopped large bunch fresh mint, leaves finely chopped finely grated zest & juice of 1 lemon pomegranate seeds (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Put the bulghur in a heatproof bowl and pour over at least twice the volume of boiling water. Leave to stand. Cut the Romanesco into roughly equal sized florets (not too large, or they will burn before they cook). Toss in just enough oil to coat and season. Roast for 15 minutes, turning once, until just starting to crisp at the edges. Put the almonds and then the pistachios in a dry frying pan (you’ll probably need to do this in batches). Dry fry, stirring now and then, until golden, then chop roughly. Check the bulghur is cooked, draining off any excess liquid. Toss in a bowl with the Romanesco, nuts, herbs and lemon zest. Season and add lemon juice and olive oil to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and scatter with pomegranate seeds, if using.
