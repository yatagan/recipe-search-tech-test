Marinated courgette, red pepper and halloumi kebabs
Introduction:
These vegetarian kebabs will need few hours to marinate, and take some time to put together, but they're worth it for the explosion of smoky flavour when you pull them off the barbecue. The saltiness of the halloumi is great for balancing out the sweet smokiness of the veg. 
Ingredients:
3-4 medium courgettes 1 red pepper 225g halloumi cheese olive oil juice of 1 lemon 1 handful fresh mint leaves, chopped 1 handful fresh oregano, marjoram or thyme leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least one hour before using. Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Cut the courgettes into 2cm slices or, if the courgettes are fat, cut them in half lengthways then into 3cm slices. Oil a baking tray, add the courgette slices and turn until they’re lightly coated with oil. Bake for 10-15 minutes until soft but with some give. De-seed the pepper and cut into 4 or 6 strips. Heat a frying or griddle pan with a little olive oil and cook the pepper pieces on both sides until fairly soft. Cut the peppers into bite size pieces. Cut the cheese into cubes the same size as or slightly smaller than the courgette pieces. To make the marinade combine 1-2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, herbs, salt and pepper. Place the cheese, courgettes and peppers in a bowl and mix in the marinade. Leave for up to 3 hours then thread onto skewers, starting with a piece of courgette and alternating the different ingredients. Cook on a barbecue or hot grill for about 5-7 minutes on each side until the halloumi is lightly scorched. Serve drizzled with a little more of the marinade if leftover. Scatter over some freshly chopped herbs.
