sausagemeat pasta sauce
Introduction:
Slow cooked sausagemeat sauce is a classic example of minced pork’s versatility. The recipe came from the first River Café Cookbook (20 years old next year), so it’s almost dinosaur food. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 2 red onions, peeled & chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled & chopped 1 good pinch of dried chilli flakes 2 bay leaves 200ml red wine 2 tins chopped tomatoes a grating of nutmeg 125g freshly grated Parmesan 125g crème fraîche for the sausagemeat: 500g minced pork 25g fennel seeds 10g salt a pinch of chilli a pinch of ground pepper
Method:
Mix the pork mince, fennel seeds, 10g of salt, chilli and ground pepper. Leave overnight if possible (but don’t worry, it will still work fine if this is not an option). Heat the oil in a heavy sauce pan (one with a lid) and fry the seasoned pork sausagemeat until the fat begins to run out. Add the bay leaves, onion, garlic and chilli and cook gently until the onions just begin to brown. Turn up the heat, add the wine and cook until it begins to evaporate. Add the tomatoes, cover and gently cook for around 1 hour. It should be good and thick – like a Bolognese. Season with the nutmeg, some sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the Parmesan and crème fraîche. Serve with a chunky pasta or in a lasagne.
