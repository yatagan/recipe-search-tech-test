griddled balsamic radicchio
Introduction:
Griddled (or fried) radicchio is smoky and tender and can either be eaten as a side or in a salad. It goes well topped with a few curls or Pecorino and eated with a grilled steak, chicken, or Italian-style sausages. Or combine it in a salad with sweet and salty accompaniments such as blue cheese, mozzarella and pears. 
Ingredients:
1 head of radicchio, cut into 1.5cm wedges, leaves still joined at the core 3 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp caster sugar 1 garlic clove, crushed salt & pepper
Method:
Heat a ridged or frying pan then griddle the radicchio wedges on a medium heat until browned on both sides and starting to wilt. Whisk together all the remaining ingredients in a shallow bowl to make a dressing and season. As you remove the wedges from the griddle, place them straight in the dressing and gently toss them to coat. Check the seasoning before serving.
