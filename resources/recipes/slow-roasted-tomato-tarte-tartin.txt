Slow roasted tomato tarte tartin
Introduction:
This is a intensely flavourful tart, redolent of summer. Although the tomatoes take a while to cook, they require little attention and the result is sublimely delicious. Eat for lunch or dinner with a crisp green salad or lightly blanched green beans. 
Ingredients:
480g cherry tomatoes, cut in half crossways a few fresh marjoram leaves (optional) olive oil 2 large or 3 small onions (red or white), finely sliced light brown sugar (1 tsp for the onions, 2 tsp for the tarte topping) 250g small potatoes, cut in ½cm rounds 20g butter 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 100g goat’s cheese, crumbled 2 sprigs thyme, leaves only 1 block ready-made butter puff pastry salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Put the tomatoes in a baking dish. Sprinkle with marjoram and a little salt and oil. Bake for 2 hours. Put the onions in a heavy-based pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Cook gently for 45 minutes-1 hour, stirring now and then, until caramelised. Boil the potatoes in salted water for 5-6 minutes until tender. Drain. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil with the butter in a 24cm heavy-based oven-proof frying pan. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar, the garlic and balsamic and stir. Increase the oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Layer the tomatoes over the base of the pan, cut side up, then the potatoes and onion. Sprinkle over the thyme and cheese. Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface and cut a circle the size of the pan. Lay it on top of the veg and tuck in the edges. Bake for about 30 minutes until golden and crispy on top. Remove from the oven. Using oven gloves, invert the pan onto a plate to tip out the tarte.
