Mushroom and leek pilaf
Introduction:
This all-in-one vegetarian pilaf makes a good quick midweek dinner. It's nutty and earthy if you use brown rice, and light and fluffy with white. Add a handful of toasted pine nuts, quick-soaked dried mushrooms or shredded cooked chicken if you like. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp oil & 1 tbsp butter (or use all oil) 1 bay leaf 2 cardamom pods, bashed once or twice with a rolling pin (optional) 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped 1 leek, cleaned & finely sliced 250g mushrooms, cleaned & chopped 300ml chicken or veg stock 200g brown or white basmati rice (dry weight), cooked fresh parsley or coriander leaves, chopped, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil and butter in a saucepan large enough to hold the rice. Add the bay leaf, cardamom pods and garlic and stir briefly. Add the leek and cook until softened, then add the mushroom and stir together. Cook for a couple of minutes more. Season. Add half the stock. Heat until the stock is hot then add the rice. Bring the stock to a simmer then add enough of the reserved stock to not quite cover the rice. Stir, cover the pan and cook on a low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring half way through, until the rice and vegetables are moist but not wet. Serve garnished with chopped parsley or coriander.
