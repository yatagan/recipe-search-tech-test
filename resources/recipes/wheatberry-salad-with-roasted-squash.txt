Wheatberry salad with roasted squash
Introduction:
This warm salad is ready in under an hour and makes a texture-rich vegetarian main course. If you don't have wheatberries, spelt, farro or pearl barley are all good substitues. Use this as a base for adding odds and ends - toasted chopped nuts, pine nuts or seeds all work a treat, as do roasted beetroot and feta. 
Ingredients:
400g wheatberries (wheat grain - or use spelt, farro or barley) 1 large or 2 small butternut squash, peeled & diced olive oil 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, chopped small knob of butter 4 leeks, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 200g mushrooms, sliced 4 sage leaves, shredded 100ml veg stock 2 small or 1 large carrot, peeled & grated large handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Bring a pan of water to the boil. Add the wheatberries and cook for 45 minutes or so, until tender but still chewy. Toss the diced squash in enough oil to coat, with half the thyme leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 35-40 minutes, until tender. Heat the butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large pan. Fry the leeks for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, the rest of the thyme and the sage. Season. Fry until the liquid from the mushrooms evaporates. Add 100ml veg stock. Stir for 2 minutes. Drain the wheatberries and toss into the mix with the squash, grated carrot and parsley. Check the seasoning and serve.
