Classic potato gratin
Introduction:
Potato gratin can be either a side dish or a meal in its own right, served with a simple green salad. Try layering the potatoes with finely sliced fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, onion, celeriac or mushrooms; or with sage or anchovies. You could also add a little grated Parmesan or Gruyère with the layers. Substitute chicken for vegetable stock for a different finish. Sweet potatoes (particularly good with sage) are a quicker cooking alternative to potatoes. If you like this recipe, invest in a mandolin vegetable slicer, which will produce fine, even slices of potatoes in minutes. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp flour 200ml double cream 200ml milk nutmeg, grated 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced 800g potatoes, peeled & cut into slices 2-3mm thick salt & pepper
Method:
Combine a little of the cream with the teaspoon of flour and mix well. In a saucepan, combine the flour mixture, the rest of the cream and the milk and a little grated nutmeg. Bring briefly to the boil, turn off the heat and put aside. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Butter a shallow ovenproof dish. In the bottom, place a layer of potatoes two or three thick. Scatter over salt and pepper, a grating of nutmeg and a few slithers of garlic. Continue building up layers until ½ an inch - an inch below the top of the dish. Pour over the milk and cream - this should just cover the potatoes and stop at least half an inch short of the top of the dish. Cover the dish with foil. Place in the oven. Cook for at least 1½ hours, until potatoes are soft (may need longer). Check from time to time - if the gratin looks dry, pour a little more cream over the top.
