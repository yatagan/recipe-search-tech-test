Purple sprouting broccoli with pilchards, parsley and tomatoes
Introduction:
Broccoli is robust enough to carry the strong flavour of oily fish. You can of course use some sardines instead, same thing really but Pilchard is a far superior word. It is common to find them already tinned with a tomato sauce these days which will save on one of the ingredients but a homemade sauce will always be the winner. You can use some olives and capers instead for a veggie version. Lovely on hot buttered toast, with fried potatoes or mixed through pasta.
Ingredients:
120-150g tin pilchards or sardines large scoop of leftover tomato sauce or passata olive oil 300g purple sprouting broccoli handful fresh parsley, chopped 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Bring a pan of salted water to a rolling boil. Open the pilchards and drain. Coarsely chop and mix with the tomatoes sauce. Gently heat in a small pan. Check the seasoning for salt and add a swirl of olive oil. Trim the purple sprouting broccoli and cut into equal sized florets. Boil for 3 - 4 minutes or until tender. Remove, drain and spoon over the warm sauce. Scatter over the parsley and serve with a squeezable wedge of lemon.
