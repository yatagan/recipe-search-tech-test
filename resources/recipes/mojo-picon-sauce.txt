Mojo picón sauce
Introduction:
In Spain this tends to be a fresh sauce made with dried peppers, but if you don’t have any strings of peppers hanging around, just use fresh. This will make a couple of jars, and will keep for at least a couple of weeks in the fridge – longer if you pour a thin layer of olive oil on the top. 
Ingredients:
4 dried or 2 fresh red peppers 4 garlic cloves, peeled ¼ tsp ground cumin 2 tsp chili flakes ½ tsp coarse salt 200ml olive oil & more for frying the bread ⅓ baguette, sliced, with most of the crust trimmed 100ml red wine or sherry vinegar
Method:
If using dried peppers, soak them in warm water for 10-15 minutes to soften and rehydrate. After soaking, drain the water and remove the stems. If using fresh peppers, remove the stems and seeds and roughly chop. Chop the garlic cloves. Whizz the peppers, cumin, garlic, chilli flakes and salt in a food processor or blender to create a paste. While blending, drizzle in olive oil gradually. Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry the sliced bread for a couple of minutes per side. Add the bread and vinegar and blitz to a paste. If it’s still very dry, add a little water. Serve with the chicken kebabs or as a relish for burgers.
