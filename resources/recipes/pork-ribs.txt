Pork ribs
Introduction:
Pork ribs are cut from the neck fillet and are always juicy and tasty however you cook them. Serve this for dinner with summer greens and brown rice noodles, or with chips or new potatoes, perhaps with a bit of chilli sauce on the side. Theyâ€™re easiest to eat if you abandon your cutlery and use your hands. 
Ingredients:
400g pork spare ribs 2 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp fresh sage or rosemary, finely chopped grated zest & juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Lay the pork steaks out on a chopping board and brush with olive oil. Rub in the crushed garlic, herbs, lemon zest and some salt and pepper. Squeeze over half the lemon juice, and leave to marinate for 15 minutes. Grill over a barbeque for 6-8 minutes, turning every 90 seconds or so, then pour over the rest of the lemon juice and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
