Rhubarb and ginger fool
Introduction:
Rustically pretty, soft, pale and creamy, rhubarb fool offers the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Serve in glasses, layered with rhubarb compote too if you like, decorated with orange zest. 
Ingredients:
3 egg yolks ½ tsp cornflour 1 tbsp caster sugar 200ml double cream 100ml milk seeds of ½ vanilla pod (or ¼ tsp vanilla extract) 450g rhubarb 1 tsp ground ginger 75g light soft brown sugar
Method:
Whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl with the cornflour and sugar. Bring the cream and milk to boiling point in a pan with the vanilla, then whisk gradually into the egg mixture. Pour back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a low heat for about 5 minutes (but keep an eye on it), until thickened. To make the fool, trim the rhubarb into short lengths and place in a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of water, the ginger, brown sugar. Bring to simmering point and cook gently for 10 - 15 minutes until the fruit is soft. Allow it to cool and when almost cold, fold the rhubarb through the custard or liquidise with the custard for a smoother result. Chill and serve.
