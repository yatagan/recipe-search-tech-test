Warm beetroot salad with orange, bacon and caraway
Introduction:
We had this recipe as a Christmas dish in the Field Kitchen with potato pancakes and smoked eel. For a more everyday meal it is excellent tossed with watercress or spinach leaves. It’ll still be good if you're vegetarian and want to leave out the bacon. 
Ingredients:
about 300g beetroot, trimmed 1 tbsp olive oil 4 smoked streaky bacon rashers, chopped 2 tsp caraway seeds 1 garlic clove, crushed 5 tbsp orange juice 1 tsp sugar 3 oranges, peeled & sliced salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Place the beets in a baking dish, add 5mm of water, then cover with foil. Place in the oven and roast for about 45 minutes, until tender. Skin the beetroot, trim the ends and slice into thick batons or wedges. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the bacon and fry until starting to brown. Remove from the pan. Add the caraway seeds and garlic and fry for a few minutes, adding the orange juice and sugar before the garlic browns. Mix thoroughly and bring to the boil. Tip in the beetroot and stir until thoroughly coated with the hot dressing. Season well. Stir in the orange slices and then sprinkle with the bacon. Transfer to a serving dish and serve immediately.
