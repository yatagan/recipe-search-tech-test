Leek and goat's cheese pancakes
Introduction:
Often the simplest ideas result in the best dinners – as with these quick-to-make vegetarian pancakes. Use any other cheese you like in place of goat's, or add a little Dijon mustard, or a grating of nutmeg. You could also replace the plain flour with buckwheat. 
Ingredients:
100g plain flour pinch salt 1 egg & 1 extra egg yolk 300ml milk 50g butter 2 tbsp olive oil 500g leeks, cleaned & finely sliced 2 tbsp herbs, e.g. chives or thyme, chopped 200g goat’s cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. To make the pancake batter, sift the flour into a large bowl, add the salt and eggs and whisk together. Gradually whisk in the milk until you have a smooth batter. Melt the butter and add a little to the batter mixture, then heat some more of the butter in a frying pan. Once the butter is hot, add a tablespoon or so of the batter, enough to cover the base. Cook the mixture for about 1½ minutes until bubbling and golden, flip and cook the other side. Stack the pancakes as you make them on a warm plate, separate each one with greaseproof paper to stop them sticking together. For the filling, gently heat the oil in a large pan, then add the leeks and cook gently for 5-6 minutes, until tender. Add the herbs then season with salt and pepper to taste. Share the mixture between the pancakes, then roll them up, before placing on a lightly greased baking tray. Before serving, warm them in the oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.
