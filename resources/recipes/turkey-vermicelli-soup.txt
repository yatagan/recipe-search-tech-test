Turkey vermicelli soup
Introduction:
This very quick and heartening soup uses up the scraps left over from a roast. With any luck you have already made stock out of the turkey or chicken carcass; if not, use chicken stock of the best quality you can find. This is also good with sweetcorn, mushrooms and finely chopped fresh ginger. 
Ingredients:
15g butter 1 small leek, halved & finely sliced 2 celery sticks, finely sliced 400ml turkey or chicken stock 1 tin cannellini beans, drained & rinsed turkey or chicken leftovers, shredded 2 vermicelli nests, scrunched to pieces celery leaves, chopped Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a saucepan with a dash of oil and sweat the sliced leek and celery until softened but not coloured. Once tender, add the stock and bring to a simmer then add the beans. Once heated through (a couple of minutes) add the turkey, seasoning, and the vermicelli. Cook for a couple of minutes then turn off the heat and scatter the celery leaves on top. Cover and leave to stand for a couple of minutes so that the pasta absorbs the stock before serving. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, then serve in warmed bowls with Parmesan to sprinkle over.
