Runner bean soup
Introduction:
This is a fairly light soup that's good if you have a glut of runner beans â€“ or even if you don't. You can turn it into more of a meal by adding some cooked diced potatoes, fried bacon lardons or leftover cooked chicken towards the end of cooking. Other herbs will work just as well as thyme, i.e. rosemary, tarragon or parsley. Dry white wine is okay to use instead of sherry but in this case bubble it for a few minutes before serving so that its taste has time to intensify. A squeeze of lemon is a nice addition at the end. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 large onion, finely chopped 300-400g runner beans, chopped very small 1litre well flavoured chicken or veg stock 1 heaped tbsp flour 2 tbsp thyme or savory, chopped 1 wineglass sherry
Method:
Melt the butter in a saucepan on a low heat and cook the onion in this until it is soft. Stir in the flour, cook for a minute or so, then blend in the stock. Bring to the boil, stirring and add the beans and herbs. Simmer uncovered, for 15-20 minutes. Pour in the sherry, check the seasoning and reheat to serve.
