Spinach kedgeree
Introduction:
Kedgeree is a comforting alliance between Indian cuisine and Victorian nursery food and very good for a quick, simple dinner. We’ve swapped the traditional smoked fish for spinach and green beans here and added smoked paprika to replicate the smoked fish flavour. Make poached rather than hard-boiled eggs if you fancy. 
Ingredients:
olive oil 2 spring onions, plus extra to garnish 1 garlic clove, crushed 4 cardamom pods, crushed 1 tsp ginger, freshly grated 1½ tsp medium hot curry powder pinch dried chilli flakes ⅛ tsp smoked paprika ¼ tsp turmeric 200g brown basmati rice, rinsed 800ml veg stock 3 eggs 100g beans (broad, french or runner), sliced 200g spinach, tough stalks removed 1 tbsp chives, chopped lemon wedges, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan, add the spring onions and fry gently for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, cardamom, ginger, curry powder, chilli, paprika and turmeric. Fry for 1 minute, then stir in the rice. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Cover and boil gently for 20 minutes. Don’t let it boil dry - top up with water if needed. Meanwhile, boil the eggs for 8 minutes. Drain, then put in a bowl of cold water. Add the beans to the rice and cook for 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for 3 minutes or so, until wilted, and the rice is tender. Remove from the heat. Peel the eggs, quarter and add to the rice. Check the seasoning and sprinkle over the chives. Serve with lemon wedges.
