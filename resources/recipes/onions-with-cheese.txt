Onions with cheese
Introduction:
Simple oven-baking caramelises onions' natural sugars, making them oozily rich and sweet. These flavourful onions are good enough to be the star or the show: eat as a main with just a pile of fluffy brown rice. Or try as a side to lamb, chicken or steak. Switch the Parmesan for another hard cheese to keep it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
8 medium white onions, peeled 2 tbsp olive oil 4 tbsp Parmesan, grated pinch nutmeg 250ml single cream ½ tsp smoked paprika salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Place the onions in a lightly oiled baking tray, one that fits them in snugly side by side. Pour over a little olive oil and bake in the oven for about an hour until soft. Remove the onions from the oven, then turn up the heat to 220°C/Gas 7. In a bowl, mix together the Parmesan, nutmeg, salt, pepper and cream. Pour the cream over the onions and sprinkle with the paprika. Return the dish to the oven for about 15 minutes until golden and bubbling.
