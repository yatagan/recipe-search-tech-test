Red Thai curry paste
Introduction:
This can be kept in the fridge for a few days or frozen in small batches and defrosted for use as required. Use about 3 tablespoons of paste for a Thai style curry for 4 people, adding your choice of meat, fish or veg, with extra chilli, lemongrass and spices to taste, with a 400ml tin of coconut milk and a little stock if needed to thin the curry sauce. For a more detailed recipe see Thai pumpkin curry or chicken and squash curry.

1 small red or white onion, chopped 1 stalk lemongrass, chopped 2 red chillies 3 garlic cloves 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & chopped 2 tbsp tomato ketchup 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 2 tbsp soy sauce (if not vegetarian use thai fish sauce) 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp chilli powder 2 tbsp lime juice Â½ tsp salt 2 tbsp coconut milk
Method:
To make the curry paste, blitz all the ingredients except the coconut milk in a food processor for a minute or two to combine. Add the coconut milk and blitz again until you have a smooth paste (add a little more coconut milk or water to thin a little if necessary).
