Lamb and mint burgers with tzatziki and greek salad
Introduction:
This is a lighter way to serve these tasty lamb and mint burgers, following a Greek flavour riff with a tzatziki dressing and a salad with our Kalamata black olives and some tangy Wootton White, a British feta-style cheese. Add some warm pitta to scoop up the salad and tzatziki, or leave out for a lighter meal, if you prefer. Marinating the red onion takes away some of its fierce pungency; try it if you'rre not a fan of raw onion. It will take a little longer in preparation.
Ingredients:
for the tzatziki: ½ a cucumber, coarsely grated ½ a pot of Riverford yoghurt 1 garlic clove, peeled & crushed or finely chopped 1 good tsp dried mint, or a handful of mint leaves, finely shredded 1 lemon, juice to taste for the Greek salad: 1 red onion, peeled, halved & finely sliced 100g salad leaves ½ a cucumber, diced 250g cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered if large 1 tsp dried oregano, or 1 tbsp of chopped fresh leaves olive oil ½ a pack of Riverford Kalamata olives, pitted pack of Wootton White cheese 4 lamb & mint burgers warm toasted pitta bread to serve (optional)
Method:
Make the tzatziki: mix the cucumber in a large bowl with half the pot of yoghurt, a good pinch of salt, the mint and a good squeeze of lemon juice to taste. For the rest of the salad, mix the oregano in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (approx half a lemon) and 3 tablespoons of good olive oil. Season with a little salt and pepper. Add the salad leaves, cucumber, cherry tomatoes and olives. Crumble up some of the Wootton White cheese and add that. Drain the red onion rings and add those. Lightly oil the lamb and mint burgers and grill or fry for approx 3-4 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Serve with the tzatziki, salad and toasted pitta bread if using.
