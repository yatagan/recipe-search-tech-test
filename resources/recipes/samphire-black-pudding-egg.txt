Samphire, black pudding and duck egg on toast
Introduction:
Samphire's salty smack holds its own beautifully against these rich flavours. The trick is to keep the cooking fast and light so as you preserve its bite and texture. The duck egg is easily replaced with a hen's, but good if you enjoy a generous ratio of yolk to white. The black pudding should be rich and crumbly, and impossible to fry in a neat slice. Eat this for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. 
Ingredients:
2 sausage sized traditional black puddings 80-100g samphire 2 duck eggs 2 slices bread butter salt & pepper
Method:
Put a frying pan on a medium heat with a slick of oil and add the black pudding, cook gently for 10 minutes. If you’ve managed to get your hands on the good stuff then it should be bursting out of the skin by this point. Slide your puds to one side of the pan, add a dash more oil and add the fresh samphire, keep it moving with a pair of tongs so it cooks but doesn’t catch. If you are feeling brave crack your eggs in the same pan. When your eggs are cooked to your liking, serve it all tumbled on hot buttered toast.
