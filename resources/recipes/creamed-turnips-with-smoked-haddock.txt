Creamed turnips with smoked haddock
Introduction:
True comfort food, this creamy, smoky, fishy purée makes a great centrepiece for dinner. It can be served very simply, in a bowl with a pile of dipping toast, a few black olives and wedges of lemon. It's also nice with a salad dressed with a sharp vinaigrette to alleviate the richness. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 500g turnips, peeled & cut into 1cm dice 300ml milk 300g undyed smoked haddock 2 tbsp double cream 2 tbsp parsley, chopped 1 tbsp capers, soaked in cold water for 20 mins, then squeezed dry & chopped 1 egg salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Melt the butter in a large pan, add the onion, garlic and turnips and cook gently, covered, for about 10 minutes, until softened. Add the milk and simmer for 10 minutes. Lay the smoked haddock over the vegetables (in pieces, if necessary) and cook for 5 minutes, until the fish is just done. Remove the haddock from the pan, taking out any bones or skin, and set aside. Drain off the milk from the turnips. Put the onion and turnips in a food processor and blitz until smooth, adding a little of the milk if necessary. Add the haddock, cream, parsley, capers and egg and blitz together quickly, then season to taste. Transfer to a shallow ovenproof dish and bake for 20 minutes, or until set.
