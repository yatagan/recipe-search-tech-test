Easy ideas for spinach
Introduction:
The spinach we put in the veg boxes is either hardier perpetual spinach or true spinach. If the stalks are very large, trim them, otherwise use the whole leaf and stalk. Wash well before use to remove any grit. 
Ingredients:
Spinach
Method:
Boil or steam until just wilted; this will take just a minute or two. It can also be wilted down in a pan with a little olive oil or butter. Try adding a little garlic and lemon juice. A classic Moorish dish is spinach wilted as above in olive oil and garlic, with raisins and pine nuts added. It’s good with lamb and fish. For some dishes, it’s best to blanch spinach before adding. Boil it for 1-2 minutes, then drain, refresh in a bowl of cold water, and drain again. Squeeze out any excess water with your hands.

For colder summer evenings, use blanched and chopped spinach to line the base of a fish pie. Add a glug of double cream and a good grating of nutmeg before carrying on with your fish pie mix.
