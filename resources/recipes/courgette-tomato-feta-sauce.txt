Courgette, tomato and feta sauce
Introduction:
This beautiful tricoloured pasta sauce makes a good, easy vegetarian weeknight dinner. This goes well with fresh penne, but use whatever pasta you have. In the absence of mint, basil also makes a good garnish. 
Ingredients:
1 large onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp olive oil 3 large courgettes, halved lengthways & cut into 1cm chunks 3 large tomatoes, chopped 200g feta cheese, cut into cubes 3 tbsp fresh mint, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Saut√© the onion and garlic in hot oil until the onion is transparent. Add the courgettes to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Chop the feta cheese into cubes and add to the pan. Season. Stir in the chopped mint. Serve with freshly cooked penne pasta.
