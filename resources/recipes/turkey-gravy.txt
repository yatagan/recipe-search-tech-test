Turkey gravy
Introduction:
Make this gravy using turkey giblet stock for the richest taste, and stir in a dollop of redcurrant jelly for a lovely layer of sweetness. If you want to save time on Christmas Day, make this ahead and keep it in the fridge for a day or two. 
Ingredients:
1 good tbsp plain flour dollop redcurrant jelly (optional) 150ml white wine (optional) 750ml turkey stock salt & pepper
Method:
Once your turkey has cooked and been removed from the roasting tin, strain off the fat in the tin leaving the turkey juices behind (the oil will float to the top, pour off most of it then use a spoon to skim off the rest). Put on a gentle heat and stir in the flour for a minute or so to cook out the flour. Add the redcurrant jelly and wine if using and stir for 1 minute. Pour in the hot stock. Scrape the base of the pan to mix in all the meaty sediment bits. Boil for a few minutes, stirring all the time to remove any lumps, until the gravy thickens. Season to taste.
