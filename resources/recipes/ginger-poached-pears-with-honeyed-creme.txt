Ginger poached pears with honeyed crème fraîche
Introduction:
These ginger-spiced poached pears with honey-sweetened crème fraîche make a lovely end to any meal. Firm winter pears are ideal for this because they hold their shape. Eat either warm or at room temperature. This is good made in advance so that the pears have time to absorb the flavour of the poaching liquid. 
Ingredients:
200g caster sugar 1 stick cinnamon 2 tbsp freshly grated ginger 4 firm pears juice of 1 lemon 250ml crème fraîche 1 tbsp clear honey
Method:
Put 500ml water in a pan with the sugar, cinnamon and ginger. Bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and bubble for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Peel the pears, cut in half lengthways and core (leave the stalks on if they are still intact). Put in a bowl and toss in the lemon juice as you go to stop them turning brown. Transfer the pears to the pan with the sugar syrup, making sure the pan is a size where the syrup can coat the pears completely. Bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes, until the pears are just tender. Leave them to cool slightly in the syrup. Stir the honey into the crème fraîche and serve with the pears.
