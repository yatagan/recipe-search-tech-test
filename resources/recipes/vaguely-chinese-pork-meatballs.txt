Vaguely Chinese pork meatballs
Introduction:
When you think meatballs, don’t just think Italian or kofta. Minced pork is a versatile blank canvas for numerous fusions of flavours. 
Ingredients:
for the meatballs: 600g minced pork 1 tbsp ground ginger 2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 2 tbsp dry sherry 4 tbsp polenta, semolina or couscous ¼ tsp freshly ground pepper 1 tsp five spice powder 6 spring onions, chopped for the broth: 2 litres chicken stock 1 head Swiss chard, sliced into strips 100g medium egg noodles, crushed in your hand into 2cm lengths, boiled for 2mins, drained & cooled
Method:
In a large bowl, mix together the meatball ingredients. Using wet hands, form the mixture into 2cm balls and place them on a wet plate. If you want something less dumpling-like, fry the meatballs in a non-stick pan or bake in a hot oven for about 7 minutes until they just begin to brown. In a large saucepan heat the stock over a medium heat until it simmers. Add the Swiss chard and the meatballs. Bring back to the simmer and cook for about 15 minutes until the chard is soft and the meatballs are cooked through. Stir in the noodles and warm through.
