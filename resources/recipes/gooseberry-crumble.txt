Gooseberry crumble
Introduction:
The use of gooseberries is a welcome alternative to the classic crumble. It's comforting, easy to make and easy to adapt – substitute half the gooseberries for apple, banana or rhubarb. Eat this with lashings of cream. 
Ingredients:
500g gooseberries grated zest & juice of 1 orange 175g plain flour 125g butter 125g caster sugar, add more to taste 60g rolled oats
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. To make the topping, put the flour and butter in a food processor and whiz until the mixture has a fine consistency. Remove and place in a bowl. Add the sugar and oats and rub together with your fingertips so the mixture is slightly lumpy and not dry. Mix the gooseberries with the orange juice and zest and place in an ovenproof dish. Top with the crumble mixture and then bake in an oven for 45 minutes, until the fruit is tender and the topping golden brown.
