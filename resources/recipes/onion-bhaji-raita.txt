Onion bhaji and raita
Introduction:
This recipe is a crisp, delicate snack, starter or accompaniment to an Indian meal. It's a good one to try making yourself: the results are almost unrecognisably better than the heavy, greasy versions you often get with take-aways. You could also make these with spring onions for an even lighter taste.
Ingredients:
100g chickpea (gram) flour or plain flour ½ tsp baking powder ¼-½ tsp cayenne or chilli powder, to taste ½ tsp turmeric ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp garam masala or curry powder ½ tsp salt, or to taste 1 large onion or 3 small onions, halved & thinly sliced handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped cold water to mix vegetable oil for deep frying 3-4 tbsp plain yoghurt handful fresh mint leaves, finely chopped pinch sugar salt, to season few drops lemon juice
Method:
Combine the flour, baking powder, spices and salt in a large bowl. Add the onion and coriander and mix well. Add just enough cold water to bring the mix into a thick batter. Heat the oil to 190°C or until a piece of bread sizzles when dropped in. Take spoonfuls of the batter and very carefully drop into the oil. Cook for 6-10 minutes or until golden brown. The bhaji can also be shallow fried but may need longer cooking and will have to be turned halfway. In either case, drain the cooked bhaji on kitchen paper. Combine the yoghurt, mint, sugar salt and lemon to make the raita, serve on the side.
