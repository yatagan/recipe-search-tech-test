Empanadillas
Introduction:
A fun child-friendly activity for a rainy weekend. 
Ingredients:
for the pastry: 200ml olive oil 60ml cider or wine vinegar 140ml water 1 tsp salt 700g plain white flour for the filling: 400-500g minced pork olive oil 400g onions, chopped 400g peppers (red or green) 6 garlic cloves, chopped 1 tbsp fennel seeds 1 tbsp paprika (substitute ½ tsp hot paprika if you have it) 2 tbsp parsley, chopped dollop of tomato puree
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. For the pastry mix all the liquids together with the salt. Add the flour until you have a smooth pastry that doesn't stick to everything it touches. For the filling, brown the minced pork in a splash of olive oil and set aside. Next fry the onions, peppers or garlic until beginning to brown. Add the meat, fennel seeds, paprika, parsley and tomato purée. Mix it well and allow to cool. To make the empanadillas, roll the pastry into 12-15cm discs (as thinly as possible), place a large tablespoon (about 50g) of filling in the middle, fold over, seal with a fork, trim and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes, or freeze for use later.
