Hay baked carrots
Introduction:
Don’t worry, we’re not trying to get you to feast on forage and fodder; the hay is there as an aromatic, much in the way you’d use any other herb. The flavour is pronounced but not over powering, more meadow pasture than rabbit hutch. Any clean hay that was destined for animal feed is suitable, you should be able to pick some up in your local pet shop. This is a dish to cook while the sun shines.
Ingredients:
500g bunched carrots olive oil few handfuls clean hay 200ml water or stock or cider or wine salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Remove the tops and give the carrots a good scrub. Keep any small carrots whole and split the larger ones into comparable sizes. Toss the carrots with a little olive oil and season well. Wrap the carrots up loosely in an envelope of muslin. Wet the hay in a bowl of water and spread half out in a roasting tray, lay the bag of carrots on top and cover with the remaining hay. Tip the water, stock, cider or wine into the tray and cover everything tightly with a double layer of foil. Bake for 45 minutes, and leave to rest for 10 minutes before opening. Lift the muslin bag straight into a serving bowl and tease it open to reveal the carrots.
