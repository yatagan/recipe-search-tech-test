Thai squash curry
Introduction:
Butternut squash is a great substitute for chicken in soupy or stewy recipes, as in this vegetarian Thai green curry. As well as making a warming dinner, this freezes very well; keep some as a weeknight back-up. Serve over jasmine or other white rice. 
Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small butternut squash, peeled & cut into 2cm dice vegetable oil 4 tbsp green curry paste 1 tin coconut milk 6 fresh Kaffir lime leaves 1-2 tsp sugar juice of 2 limes 2 tbsp Thai fish sauce or 1 tbsp soy sauce 1-2 bird's-eye chillies, finely sliced (optional) handful Thai basil leaves, if possible, or sweet basil, to finish salt & pepper
Method:
Sweat the squash in a couple of tablespoons of oil until the edges are beginning to soften. In a separate large pan, fry the curry paste in some more oil for a couple of minutes, until fragrant. Add the coconut milk and half of the lime leaves and bring up to boil. Add the sugar, lime and fish sauce to taste, plus the chillies if you like things spicy - you are aiming for a good balance of hot, sweet, salty and sour. Add the squash and simmer in the sauce until tender. Finely sliver the remaining lime leaves and add to the sauce, along with the basil leaves. Taste for seasoning and serve over the rice.
