Spiced aubergine and tomato (iman bageldi)
Introduction:
This makes a fantastic weeknight meal: the aubergine softens and soaks up the taste of the herbs and spices. This rich enough to hold its own as a vegetarian main, perhaps paired with a green salad. It would also go well with lamb or a sprinkling of goat's cheese. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 aubergine, diced into 1cm squares 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 440g tin chopped tomatoes 1 tsp sugar pinch ground allspice pinch cayenne pepper splash balsamic vinegar fresh coriander, mint or parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large frying pan heat up olive oil and saut√© diced aubergine until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon onto kitchen roll to remove excess oil. Add sliced garlic to remaining oil in the pan. Cook for a few minutes on a low heat. Before the garlic turns brown add tinned tomatoes with the sugar, allspice and cayenne. Turn up and reduce tomato down for about 10 minutes until very thick. Add aubergine back to the pan with the tomato sauce - heat through gently and add a splash of balsamic vinegar. Season well. Finish with fresh herbs.
