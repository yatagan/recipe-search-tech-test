Celeriac sauce
Introduction:
This quick and easy sauce goes equally well with the delicate flavours of seafood, with braised mushrooms, or with game. 
Ingredients:
1 large celeriac 2 garlic cloves, peeled 500ml milk salt & pepper
Method:
Chop the celeriac into 2cm dice and cook with the garlic cloves in the milk. Make sure the milk is completely covered - add more if needed. Drain, reserving the milk and pass through a food mill (or whiz in a food processor). Stir in a few tablespoons of the milk to loosen the consistency and season to taste.
