Papaya salsa
Introduction:
Papaya is most often used in savoury dishes in its unripe green form, where the texture rather than taste is key. In this salsa, it is the sweet ripe fruit we want. The salt, chilli and lime save it from being too dessert-like. It is perfect with Tex-Mex style tacos or fajitas, and ideal with fish. The sweetness of the papaya may depend on its ripeness, so you could enhance it with a pinch or two of sugar at the end, to taste.
Ingredients:
½ a ripe papaya, chopped into 1cm dice 1 shallot or ½ red onion, very finely diced 1 lime, zested & juiced handful fresh coriander, chopped red chilli, finely chopped olive oil brown sugar (optional)
Method:
Mix the papaya and shallot together. Add the lime zest and half the juice, along with the coriander, chilli and 1 tbsp olive oil. Season with a little salt and pepper. Mix and taste. Add some sugar and a little more lime juice if you think it needs it.
