Halloumi kebabs with harissa yoghurt dressing
Introduction:
The saltiness of the halloumi is balanced out by fresh herbs and sweet summer veg. With its spicy harissa dresing this is a great vegetarian dish for a summer barbecue – or cook on a grill and eat with couscous and salad for a light dinner. 
Ingredients:
100g yoghurt ½ tsp harissa paste (or more to taste) 1 tsp whole green peppercorns, crushed in a pestle & mortar (or use freshly ground black pepper) 1 garlic clove, peeled & crushed juice of ½ lemon 2 tbsp olive oil 1 small red pepper, de-seeded & chopped into 8 pieces 1 courgette, cut on the diagonal into 8 pieces 6 cherry tomatoes 100g halloumi, cut into large chunks 8 whole basil leaves 8 whole mint leaves 2 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 10 mins to stop them burning
Method:
To make the dressing, stir the yoghurt and harissa together in a small bowl. Leave to one side. To make the marinade, use a small whisk or fork to combine the peppercorns, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil together in a small bowl. Gently push the remaining kebab ingredients onto the skewer, alternating each one (finish with a cherry tomato on the end of the skewer). Heat a griddle or grill to a medium heat (or cook on the BBQ). Use a pastry brush to cover the kebabs in some of the marinade, then place on the griddle. Cook for about 10 minutes or so, turning and brushing with more marinade every couple of minutes, until the veg is just tender and the halloumi is turning golden. Serve with the yoghurt dressing.
