3 simple root mashes (with wonderful names)
Introduction:
These are simple, sturdy sides that are perfectly in season and more than the sum of their parts. All recipes serve 2 and should be ready inside 30 minutes.
Ingredients:
parsnip skordalia 500g parsnips, peeled & chopped 1 bay leaf 200ml milk 40g flaked almonds, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan 1 garlic clove, finely chopped or crushed 30g fresh breadcrumbs 40ml olive oil 1 lemon rumbledethumps 600g leftover mashed potato, made with a little butter & milk 1 onion, sliced ¼ Savoy cabbage, finely shredded pinch nutmeg 80g mature Cheddar, grated clapshot (neeps & tatties) 250g swede, cooked & mashed 250g potatoes, cooked & mashed 25g butter 50ml milk or cream small bunch chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Parsnip skordalia: Put the parsnips in a pan with the bay leaf and cover with the milk. Bring gently to the boil and simmer until very soft, about 15-20 minutes. Strain the parsnips and reserve the milk. Put the parsnips in a food processor with a dash of the milk and blend until smooth. Add the breadcrumbs, almonds and the garlic, and blend while adding the olive oil in a steady stream until it comes together. Add the juice of at least ¼ the lemon and a good pinch of salt. Check the seasoning, and adjust with more salt or lemon to taste. Rumbledethumps: Fry the onion in a little oil until starting to soften, about 10 minutes. Add the cabbage and cook for a further 5 minutes until wilted but still nice and bright green. Fold roughly with the mash, season with salt, black pepper and a little nutmeg. Pack into a snug oven dish, top with the cheese and bake at 200˚C/Gas 6 for 20 minutes, or until golden brown on top. Clapshot (neeps & tatties): While the swede and potatoes are still hot, mash them with the butter, milk and chopped chives. Season.
