Green Mary blend (tomatillo smoothie)
Introduction:
A Mexican permutation of this punchy pick-me-up. Tomatillos are one of our quirkier crops. Tangy and citrus-sweet, the Mexicans use them in almost everything. Because they contain so much pectin, your blend may appear to thicken and solidify if left for a while; just give it a stir to revive it. Be cautious with the chilli – you can always blend in more at the end. If you want to make it properly grown-up, mix with a few shots of vodka, or more appropriately tequila, and tweak with lime juice and a scant pinch of salt. 
Ingredients:
200g tomatillos, husks removed 2 mini cucumbers ½ tbsp dark brown sugar 1cm piece of green chilli, deseeded small cup of ice
Method:
Place everything in a powerful blender and whizz until it makes a thick but drinkable blend. Add a dash of water if it’s too thick.
