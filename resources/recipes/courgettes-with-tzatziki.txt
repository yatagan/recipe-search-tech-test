Courgettes with tzatziki
Introduction:
This vegetarian Greek combination makes a lovely thirst-quenching summer starter or can be eaten as part of a mezze spread. Cooling tzatziki also makes a good salad dressing, or an accompaniment to grilled lamb chops. 
Ingredients:
for the tzatziki: 1 tsp dried mint 500ml natural yoghurt 1 cucumber, deseeded & grated 1 garlic clove, crushed with ½ tsp sea salt juice of ½ lemon for the courgettes: 50g butter 50ml olive oil 4 courgettes 1 chilli, finely sliced handful of fresh mint, chopped 1 tsp red wine vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
To make the tzatziki, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Season to taste. Leave to chill in a fridge until required. Cut the courgettes in half lengthways and chop into 1cm chunks. Melt the butter in a pan with the oil and add the courgettes and chilli. Cook over a medium heat until tender and lightly browned. Sprinkle the courgettes with the mint and vinegar. Season well and serve hot with the tzatziki dip on the side.
