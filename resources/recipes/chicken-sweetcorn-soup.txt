Chicken and sweetcorn soup
Introduction:
A creamy, meal-in-a-bowl style soup, this is very simple to make and the best sort of comfort food for a chilly day. If you havenâ€™t got vermicelli to hand, use another small pasta shape. Stir in a handful of chopped parsley or spinach at the very end of the cooking time for something a little greener. 
Ingredients:
1 sweetcorn cob 1 skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips 200ml chicken stock 50ml double cream 40g vermicelli pasta 1 tsp cornflour 1 tbsp milk salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water, cook the sweetcorn for about 10-12 minutes. Drain, leave to cool, then cut off the kernels with a sharp knife. Put the chicken pieces, stock and cream in a large saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Meanwhile, in a large pan of boiling water, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Drain and keep to one side. Mix the cornflour and milk together into a smooth paste. Add to the soup and stir to combine and thicken the soup. Add the sweetcorn and pasta and season to taste.
