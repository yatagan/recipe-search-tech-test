Roasted cauliflower and goat's cheese bake
Introduction:
Roasting is one the best ways to prepare cauliflower – it keeps its texture and brings out a sweet nuttiness. Lightly seasoned with cumin, thyme and paprika, and with the sweet succulence of the tomatoes and the tang of the goat's cheese, this makes a lovely, flavourful vegetarian main. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, cut into small florets olive oil 1 egg 2 egg yolks 1 tsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted ¼ tsp ground paprika 200g tinned chopped tomatoes 250ml crème fraîche or double cream 100ml milk 1 tsp dried thyme (or use the leaves from a couple of fresh sprigs) 150g hard goat’s cheese, crumbled 50g Parmesan cheese, grated 50g breadcrumbs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Put the cauliflower in a baking dish and toss in just enough olive oil to coat, then bake for 25 minutes. Beat the egg and egg yolks in a bowl, then add the cumin, paprika, tomatoes, crème fraîche, milk and thyme. Season with salt and pepper and stir it all together gently to combine, then pour the lot over the cauliflower. In another bowl, mix together the goat’s cheese, Parmesan and breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over the cauliflower mixture, and bake for about 45-50 minutes or so, until the top is golden and crispy.
