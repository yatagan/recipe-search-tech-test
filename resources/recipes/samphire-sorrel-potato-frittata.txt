Samphire, sorrel and new potato frittata
Introduction:
Samphire doesnâ€™t have to be served with fish or meat, it teams beautifully with eggs as well. This frittata takes less than 20 minutes to make, and is a great vegetarian lunch or dinner that can be eaten warm or at room temperature. All it needs is a green salad or pile of quick-blanched French or green beans on the side. Beware of samphire's inherent saltiness when adding any extra to the mix. 
Ingredients:
250g new potatoess, scrubbed clean & thickly sliced a little butter & oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 4 large or 6 smaller sorrel leaves, finely shredded 6 eggs, beaten 50g samphire, washed salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the sliced potatoes for 5 minutes in a pan of salted boiling water. Drain them and leave to one side. Heat a knob of butter and a splash of oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the sorrel and stir for 1 minute. Add the drained potatoes, beaten eggs, samphire, salt and a good grinding of black pepper to season. Cook for a few minutes, enough to set the bottom. Finish under the grill or in the oven, until the frittata is just set all the way through.
