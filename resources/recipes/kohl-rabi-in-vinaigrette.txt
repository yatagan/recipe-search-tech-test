Kohlrabi in vinaigrette
Introduction:
With its bulbous, alien appearance kohlrabi (also known as cabbage turnip) is a much-overlooked. It has a radish-like crunch and a turnipy mildness that's easily enjoyed â€“ as in this quick, healthy side dish. 
Ingredients:
4 medium sized kohlrabi 60ml olive oil juice of 1 lemon 10ml Dijon mustard 30ml parsley, chopped 15ml Parmesan cheese salt & pepper
Method:
Trim the kohlrabi, cut in half and slice them thinly. Place them in a saucepan with the oil, cover and set them on a low heat. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring around frequently. They are ready when they are translucent and a little crunchy. Stir in the lemon juice, mustard and parsley and bring to the boil. Season, and serve straight away, scattered with the cheese.
