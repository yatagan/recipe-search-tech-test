Chicken, broad beans and new potatoes with mustard and tarragon
Introduction:
The tarragon's lemon-aniseed flavour and the sharpness of mustard combine in a creamy sauce that really brings together this summer trio of chicken, new potatoes and broad beans. Nothing more is needed for a lovely dinner – though a crisp green salad wouldn't go amiss. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp oil for frying 4x chicken thighs & 4 x drumsticks, about 1kg 1 large onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 500ml dry cider 2 bay leaves 400ml hot chicken or veg stock 700g broad beans in their pods, shelled 700g new potatoes, halved or quartered if large 2 tbsp course grain mustard 2 tbsp double cream or crème fraîche large handful fresh tarragon leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the chicken and fry on all sides until brown. Don’t overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary. Remove to a plate. Add the onion to the same pan, with a little more oil if needed. Fry gently for 6 minutes. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes. Add the cider, bring to the boil and let it bubble away for 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan, with any juices from the plate. Add the bay leaves and stock. Season. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. While that pot is simmering, in another pan of boiling water, cook the broad beans for 4 minutes. Drain, refresh in a bowl of cold water, then remove the outer skins to reveal the bright green beans. Leave to one side. Add the potatoes to the chicken pot. Cover and simmer for another 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are just tender. Check the chicken is cooked through (simmer a little longer if needed). Add the broad beans, mustard and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the tarragon and check the seasoning before serving.
