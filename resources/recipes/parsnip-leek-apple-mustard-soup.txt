Parsnip, leek, apple and mustard soup
Introduction:
Leeks, parsnips and apple give this easy-to-make soup a mild, comforting sweetness which is set off to perfection by the kick of mustard. If you don't have beer mustard, any other wholegrain mustard is fine – though perhaps also add a pinch of chilli so you get the equivalent kick. For a more elaborate bowl, deep-fry some finely shredded leeks, and top your soup with a swirl of crème fraîche, crispy leeks and, if you're not vegetarian, perhaps some fried lardons of bacon. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. rapeseed 1 large leek, shredded (use the white & green parts) 2 large parsnips, peeled & diced 1 apple, peeled, cored & diced 1.2 litre veg stock 1 tbsp beer mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablesoon of oil in a large saucepan. Add the leek and fry gently for 8 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the parsnips and stir for 1 minute. Add the apple, stock and season. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes or so, until the parsnips are tender. Blend until smooth. Put back in the same pan and stir in the mustard. Reheat gently. Check the seasoning and serve.
