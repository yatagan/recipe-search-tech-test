Pink mash
Introduction:
A vibrant variation on traditional mash, this is good with steak and roast beef. You could also try making it with carrots instead of beets for a different hue. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & cut into chunks 1 bay leaf 4 small-medium beetroot, washed & halved (not peeled) 1-2 tbsp butter 2-3 tbsp cream or milk 1-2 tsp fresh or bottled grated horseradish, to taste (fresh is hotter) salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes in plenty of salted water with the bay leaf until soft. Drain, remove the bay leaf and allow potatoes to steam dry in the hot pan for 10 minutes. Meanwhile in a separate pan, boil the beetroot until soft. Drain and once it has cooled slightly, rub off the skin using a kitchen towel or wear gloves and use your fingers. Purée the beetroot in a food processor or blender. Mash or rice the potatoes until smooth (do not process as the mash can be overworked). Add the butter while the potato is still hot and mix through, then add the beetroot purée. Stir and add milk or cream, then add horseradish, salt and pepper to taste. Reheat before serving.
