Thai pork salad
Introduction:
For some reason beef seems to be the chosen meat for Thai salads, but pork works even better. Vary the vegetables according to availability – the same applies to the herbs, but the mint is essential. The dressing is also cast in stone; the cornerstone in fact, of so much Thai food. Slices of ripe mango are also a good addition. Frozen kaffir lime leaves are available from Asian supermarkets for about £2 a bag. Don’t use the dried ones, they’re a waste of space. Leave the pork to marinade for a couple of hours to let the flavours muddle. 
Ingredients:
for the dressing: juice of 1 lime 1 tbsp dark sugar, palm ideally 1 tbsp fish sauce 2 tsp sesame oil 1 tsp soy sauce 2 tsp fresh ginger, finely grated 1 garlic clove, crushed for the salad: 450g pork escalopes 2 Little Gem lettuces, roughly broken up 1 cucumber, halved length-ways, thinly sliced diagonally 5 spring onions, thinly sliced 2 long fresh red chillies, halved, deseeded & thinly sliced length-ways leaves from 1 bunch fresh mint leaves from 1 bunch fresh coriander leaves from 1 bunch fresh basil 60g toasted unsalted peanuts, lightly toasted & coarsely chopped 4 fresh or frozen kaffir lime leaves, centre veins removed, finely shredded
Method:
Make the dressing: Whisk together all of the ingredients: lime juice, palm sugar, fish sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and garlic in a jug. Place the pork escalopes in a glass dish and marinate in half the dressing. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for a couple of hours. For the salad: Preheat a griddle to high and quickly sear the pork. Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and set aside to rest. Place the lettuce, cucumber, spring onions, chilli, mint, coriander, basil, peanuts and lime leaves in a large bowl. Slice the pork into ribbons and add to the salad. Gently mix in the remaining dressing.
