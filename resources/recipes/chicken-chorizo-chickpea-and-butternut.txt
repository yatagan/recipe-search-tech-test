Chicken, chorizo, chickpea and butternut squash
Introduction:
A richly flavoured and coloured Spanish-style stew. Serve with crusty bread, rice or couscous and lots of black pepper. You could also try making this with diced pork instead of chicken. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp oil for frying 1 onion, finely chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 250g cooking chorizo, broken into chunks 450g diced chicken leg 150ml red wine 1 red pepper, deseeded & sliced 2 tins chopped tomatoes 1 tbsp dark brown sugar 500g butternut squash, peeled, deseeded & cut into 3cm dice 1 tin chickpeas, drained 2 tbsp parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or casserole dish. Gently fry the onion for 10 mins, until softened without colouring. Add the chilli and garlic and cook for 2 mins. Transfer to a plate. Add the chorizo and chicken to the same pan, with a splash more oil if needed. Raise the heat to brown the chicken all over. Season with some salt and pepper, pour in the wine, and continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the pepper, tomatoes and sugar, stir to incorporate then lower to a simmer for 10 minutes. Fold the squash into the stew and cook for a further 40-45 minutes until both chicken and squash are tender. By now the colour will be richly red from the chorizo and tomatoes and the sauce thick and pleasantly warm to the taste buds. Fold in the chickpeas and cook for a final few minutes, then stir in freshly chopped parsley and check the seasoning before serving.
