southern Italian sausage meat
Introduction:
Pork mince has all sorts of uses: in rag√πs with pasta, meatballs, various South East Asian dishes and more. In fact, most beef mince recipes can be improved by substituting 25-50% of the mince with pork. You might beg to differ, but it seems to lighten things up and make the dishes more receptive to other flavours. A good place to start with minced pork is to make your own sausage meat... 
Ingredients:
350g pork mince 25g breadcrumbs 50ml white wine 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp fennel seeds, ground pinch dried chilli 1 level tsp salt
Method:
Mix the pork mince with the breadcrumbs, white wine, garlic cloves, fennel seeds, dried chilli and salt. This mix makes great burgers, meatballs and pasta sauces.
