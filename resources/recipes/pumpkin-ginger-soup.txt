Pumpkin and ginger soup
Introduction:
This is a cold weather soup with just the right balance of sweetness and punchy ginger. Serve it with a dollop of crème fraîche or yoghurt to serve if you have some. If you'd like a vegan version, use agave instead of honey, and try coconut milk rather than cow's milk to thin the soup. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, roughly chopped 1kg squash or pumpkin, peeled, deseeded & diced 5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 1 tbsp honey 1 litre veg or chicken stock milk to thin the soup pinch paprika or nutmeg salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes, without colouring. Add the squash, ginger and honey. Stir and add the stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 20-25 minutes until the squash is tender. Blitz in a blender. Reheat, adding just enough milk to thin the soup to the consistency you want. Season and sprinkle over a little paprika or nutmeg to serve.
