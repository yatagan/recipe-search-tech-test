Diana Cooper's cabbage with sesame, caraway and vinegar
Introduction:
Sautéing is one of the easiest ways to prepare cabbage. Here, it's taste is complemented by the aromatic anise of caraway and the sharpness of the vinegar added at the end. This would make a great quick dinner alongside some fried pork chops. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp toasted sesame oil 1 smallish onion, sliced finely pinch of caraway seeds (try a larger amount of sesame or poppy seeds if you don't like caraway) ½ white cabbage, round cabbage, or 1 January King, shredded fairly finely 1 tbsp white wine vinegar salt
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok. Add the onions and caraway and fry until starting to soften. Add the cabbage and fry, turning continuously until the cabbage is cooked but still has a little crunch left in it (about 4 minutes). Add the vinegar and salt to taste. Turn a few more times and serve.
