Smoky chorizo stuffed poblano peppers
Introduction:
We’ve been growing Poblano peppers on our farm in the Vendée. They have thin skins, a slightly bitter flavour and are great for stuffing. Serve these with salad or a cooked sweetcorn cob, with melted butter and lots of black pepper. To skin tomatoes, cut a small cross in each skin at the base. Put in a heatproof bowl and pour over boiling water to cover. Leave for 30-45 seconds or so, until the skin starts to peel away. Drain, run under cold water to cool, then slip off the skins.
Ingredients:
6-8 poblano peppers, about 500g olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 2 chorizo sausages, crumbled out of their skins 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped, grated or crushed ½ tsp smoked paprika 4 small thyme sprigs, leaves only 4 tomatoes, skinned & diced 200g (dried weight) long grain brown rice, cooked 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 50g Cheddar, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Cut the peppers in half, keeping the stalks intact if you can to help them keep their shape. Place cut side up in a baking dish and drizzle with oil. Bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and cook on a low heat until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching (if it does start to catch, add a splash of water, stir well and turn the heat down). Add the chorizo, garlic, paprika and thyme leaves. Season and turn the heat up a little. Fry, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked rice and chopped parsley. Check the seasoning. Spoon the mixture into the peppers. Sprinkle over the cheese. Bake for 10 minutes until the cheese has melted.
