Green banana jerk stew
Introduction:

Ingredients:
oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 3 spring onions, sliced 3 green bananas, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces salt & pepper 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 2 tbsp jerk seasoning: ½ tbsp dried thyme 1 tsp allspice berries 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tsp caster sugar ½ tsp cayenne pepper – or to taste ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ teaspoon ground ginger ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg 1 tin chopped tomatoes 1 tin cooked black beans, drained 400ml vegetable stock 100g baby spinach 1 lime 1 tbsp peanut butter (optional) cooked rice to serve
Method:
Warm 2 tablespoons of oil in a saucepan. Add the onions, bananas and a pinch of salt. Cook gently for 5 minutes until the onions start to soften. Add the garlic and jerk seasoning to the pan and cook for 1 minute, stirring to make sure the spices don’t burn. Tip in the tomatoes, beans and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 20-30 minutes, until the bananas are tender. When the stew is ready, stir in the spinach until wilted. Taste and tweak the seasoning with salt, pepper and a squeeze or two of lime. If you want to add the peanut butter, put it in a bowl and add a ladle of liquid from the stew. Mix it into a paste and add it back into the pan. If you don’t do this, it tends to stay in one piece and doesn’t distribute easily. Serve with rice and some wedges of remaining lime.
