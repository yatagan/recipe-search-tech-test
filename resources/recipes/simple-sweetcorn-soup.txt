Simple sweetcorn soup
Introduction:
This unfussy soup is gentle, mild and sweetly tasty; it's very popular with children. There are few ingredients, which allow the sweetcorn to shine. Try to use the freshest possible cobs. After a day or two in the fridge they lose their sublime sweetness as the the sugars convert to starch. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 25g butter 3 corn cobs water milk salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onion and garlic in a little butter until soft, then add the kernels from the cobs of corn and cover with a mixture of half water and half milk. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until the corn is tender, then pur√©e and pass through a sieve. Reheat and adjust the seasoning.
