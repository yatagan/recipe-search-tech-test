Stuffed squash with kale, red cabbage and beetroot salad
Introduction:
This is a healthy and delectable vegetarian autumn or winter dinner. Roasted squash filled with feta, quinoa and fresh herbs, served with a crunchy, super-nutritious salad of raw red cabbage, kale and red onion, sprinkled with toasted seeds. 
Ingredients:
1 small squash (about 600g) olive oil 25g quinoa (red gives a nutty flavour) 100g feta 2 tbsp fresh mint & parsley, chopped ¼ red cabbage, leaves finely shredded ½ red onion, thinly sliced 1 small beetroot, peeled & cut into thin matchsticks, or coarsely grated 50g kale, leaves torn into small pieces 1 tbsp olive oil splash cider vinegar ½ tsp Dijon mustard 3 tbsp mixed seeds, toasted in a dry frying pan for 1 min salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Cut the squash in half lengthways, scoop out the seeds, season and drizzle generously with oil. Place cut side down on a non-stick baking tray and roast until tender - about 30 minutes. Cook the quinoa in boiling water for 12 minutes, drain and leave to cool slightly, then mix with the feta, herbs and a drizzle of olive oil. Scatter the cabbage, beetroot, onion and kale on a serving plate. In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil, mustard and vinegar. Season, then drizzle over the veg. Scatter over the seeds. Serve the squash filled with the quinoa and feta, with the salad on the side.
