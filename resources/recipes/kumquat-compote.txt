Kumquat compote
Introduction:
Kumquats are small, sharp fruits. They can be eaten raw, skin and all, or cooked down with a little sugar to temper the sour taste. The skins soften but keep a faint bite, not unlike the shreds in marmalade. The sweetness is just enough, but not so much as to make it jam-like. You can make this recipe festive with the addition of 2 cloves and a star anise, if it is that time of year.
Ingredients:
400g kumquats 220g sugar 20g fresh ginger, sliced 1 cinnamon stick 50ml orange liqueur or sweet dessert wine
Method:
Cut the kumquats into quarters. Remove and discard the seeds. Place the fruit in a saucepan with the sugar, ginger, cinnamon and liqueur. Add 100ml of water and bring it up to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes, until the fruit is soft and the liquid syrupy. You can make this well in advance if you like; it will keep in the fridge for a week.
