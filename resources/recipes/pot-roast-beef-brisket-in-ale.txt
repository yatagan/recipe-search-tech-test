Pot roast beef brisket in ale
Introduction:
Brisket is an economical cut of beef and much underused. It’s suitable for a slow cook to tenderise the meat. It does shrink up a little in cooking but there’s plenty on our joint for 2 meals for 4, especially if you’re following our less meat campaign. Serve the pot roast with plenty of seasonal veg and there’s lots of ready-made gravy so you’ll need some mash to mop up the juices. 
Ingredients:
1.3kg beef brisket oil for frying e.g. sunflower or light olive 4 carrots 2 onions 2 celery sticks 1 tbsp plain flour 1 bottle of ale (500ml) 4 good thyme sprigs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat your oven to 150˚C/Gas 2. Rub the brisket with a little oil and season all over with a little salt and pepper. Heat a flameproof casserole, one with a lid, that one fits the meat fairly snugly. Fry the brisket to seal and brown it on all sides (this will take a good few minutes, longer than you might think). Transfer the brisket to a plate. Add the carrots, onions, celery to the same pan. Fry on a low heat, stirring now and then, for 10 minutes to get them on their way. Add the flour and stir for 2 minutes. Add the bottle of ale and thyme. Pop the brisket back in, with any juices from the plate. You want the liquid to be about two-thirds up the brisket, so top up with a little water or stock if needs be. Season with salt and pepper, bring up to a low boil, pop on a lid and cook in the oven for 4 hours until tender. Remove the beef and slice half of it to serve 4, saving the rest for leftovers.
