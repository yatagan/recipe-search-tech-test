New potato, spinach and Gruyère bake
Introduction:
This summer bake makes an easy and delicious vegetarian dinner with a robust green salad on the side. For a heartier meal, eat it as a side with roast chicken or ham. If you don't have any Gruyère substitute in any other cheese for a slightly different taste. Chard is a good stand-in for spinach if that's what you have in your box – be doubly sure to remove the tough stalks.
Ingredients:
600g new potatoes, scrubbed & halved or quartered if large 200g spinach, tough stalks removed a little butter for greasing 1 tbsp cornflour 150ml milk 3 eggs 250ml double cream ¼ tsp nutmeg, grated 100g Gruyère cheese, grated salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling salted water, cook the potatoes for 12-15 minutes, until just tender. Drain and keep to one side. While the potatoes are bubbling away, cook the spinach in a separate pan of boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain and plunge into a bowl of cold water to refresh. Drain again. Use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Roughly chop the leaves. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. With a little bit of butter on a piece of kitchen paper, lightly grease a 2 litre capacity gratin or baking dish. Blend the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of milk in a bowl. Break in the eggs and whisk together. Whisk in the rest of the milk and cream. Add the nutmeg and cheese and season. Mix the potatoes, spinach and egg mixture in the baking dish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and puffy.
