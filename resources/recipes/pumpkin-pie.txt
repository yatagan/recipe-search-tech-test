Pumpkin pie
Introduction:
Colourful, autumnal and richly spiced, this is often served with lashings of whipped cream. Outside the spooky season you can swap pumpkin for butternut squash, which you'll get more often in your veg box. We may not have Thanksgiving but that's no reason not to enjoy this indulgent treat. 
Ingredients:
175g plain flour pinch salt 75g margarine 2 tbsp cold water 500g pumpkin, peeled & diced into 2cm cubes 1 tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp ground mixed spice ½ tsp ground ginger 100g brown sugar 3 eggs 150g single cream
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Cut the margarine into small pieces and rub into the flour until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water to mix into a firm dough, then wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, steam the pumpkin for 10 minutes until tender. Drain, transfer to a liquidizer and blend until smooth. Put the pumpkin in a mixing bowl and beat in the remaining ingredients with an electric or hand whisk. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to line a 20cm flan dish. Prick the entire surface with a fork and bake blind for 15 minutes until just firm to the touch. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the pastry base and bake for 45-50 minutes until set.
