Chorizo, chickpeas, lentils and greens
Introduction:
This is a simple, pungent, meal in a bowl, made mainly from ingredients you're likely to have in the cupboard. Very good for a quick midweek dinner. You can add more chard if you like, or use other greens – cabbage, kale, shredded Brussels sprouts or spinach. Serve on its own or with crusty bread. If you're vegetarian, leave out the chorizo. This reheats and freezes well. 
Ingredients:
100g Puy lentils 2 tbsp olive oil 75g cooking chorizo, chopped 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 2 tsp ground cumin 2 tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼-½ tsp dried chilli flakes 4 fresh tomatoes, chopped, or use ½ can tinned tomatoes 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed & drained ½ head chard, leaves shredded, stalks finely chopped 1.2 litre chicken or veg stock juice of ½ lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Put the lentils in a large saucepan, add water to cover, bring to boil, simmer for 20 minutes, until tender. Drain. Heat the oil, fry chorizo, onion, garlic. Add spices and chilli. Fry for a couple more minutes. Add tomatoes, chickpeas, chard, stock. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add the lentils back to the pan and continue to simmer for a couple of minutes until they are warmed through. Season. Add lemon juice to taste.
