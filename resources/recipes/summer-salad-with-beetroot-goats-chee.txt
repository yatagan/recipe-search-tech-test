Summer salad with beetroot, goat's cheese and French beans
Introduction:
This straightfoward, seasonal salad has a lovely contrast of taste and texture and is just the thing for a light lunch. Or eat it for dinner with grilled lamb chops. For an autumnal version, substitute roasted squash for the beetroot. 
Ingredients:
300g mixed summer salad leaves 150g French beans, trimmed 200g cooked beetroot, cut into 2cm cubes 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp red wine vinegar or sherry vinegar 100g soft goat’s cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Wash the salad leaves and dry well. Cook the beans in boiling salted water for 3–4 minutes, until just tender, then drain, refresh in cold water and drain again. Put them in a large bowl with the salad leaves and beetroot. Whisk the olive oil, vinegar and some seasoning together to make a dressing. Toss with the salad then sprinkle with goat’s cheese.
