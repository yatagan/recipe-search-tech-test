Pork, fennel and chilli pasta sauce
Introduction:
This pasta dish takes a while to simmer to its full richness, but requires no attention but the occasional stir. Minced beef is good for it, but minced pork is better – it lightens things up, which allows other flavours to develop. If you don't have any mince, squeeze out the inside of some Italian-style sausages. This goes well with long flat ribbons of linguine or fettucine, but any pasta will do. 
Ingredients:
400-500g pork mince 1 tsp fennel seeds olive oil 2 red onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 dried chillies, crumbled (or use chilli flakes) 2 bay leaves 200ml red wine 2 tins chopped tomatoes pinch nutmeg, grated 50g Parmesan 200ml double cream or crème fraîche
Method:
Mix the minced pork with the fennel seeds, season well, and fry in a flameproof casserole dish in olive oil, keeping it on the move, for 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, chilli, and bay leaves, and fry gently for half an hour. Turn up the heat and add a large glass of red wine. Stir for a couple of minutes, then add 2 tins of chopped tomatoes. Bring to the boil, allow some of the liquid to evaporate, then put on a lid and simmer for an hour. Grate in some nutmeg, a handful of Parmesan and the cream or crème fraîche. Stir until everything is incorporated and check the seasoning. Serve with pasta and a green salad.
