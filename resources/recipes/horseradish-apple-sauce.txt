Horseradish and apple sauce
Introduction:
This classic creamy and piquant sauce is a good partner for anything from grilled pork chops and sausages to roasted beetroot or spiced or roast beef. Makes a few jars. 
Ingredients:
2 bramley apples, cored, peeled & diced 3 cloves 3 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp lemon juice 100g horseradish, grated
Method:
Place the apples in a saucepan with the cloves, sugar and 50ml of water. Cook gently, stirring occasionally until the apple has collapsed. Add the lemon juice and finely grated horseradish. If you like your horseradish hot, remove the pan from the heat and spoon into a bowl. If you don’t mind some of the flavour dissipating, you can bring back up to temp and ‘hot fill’ into sterile jars – it will keep, unopened, for ages.
