Pork, fennel & cider meatballs
Introduction:
Fennel and pork is a classic combination; the anise flavours are mellowed by cooking. Cider adds extra depth and sweetness. Using sausages instead of making meatballs saves time, making this a quick supper option.
Ingredients:
1 red onion 1 fennel oil for frying 1 garlic clove 4 pork sausages 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 bay leaf 100ml cider 1 tin chopped tomatoes salt & pepper 200g linguine 25g grated Italian style hard cheese
Method:
Peel and finely slice the onion. Halve the fennel. Trim away and discard any tough stalks and root, then thinly slice. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a saucepan. Add the onion, fennel and a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat for 10 mins, until starting to soften and take on a little colour - make sure they don’t burn. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Split the sausage skins and remove the meat. Break each sausage into about 6 chunks; these are your meatballs. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the meatballs on all sides until nicely browned. Add the garlic and fennel seeds to the fennel. Gently fry for 2 mins. Add the tomato purée, bay leaf and cider. Let the cider bubble away for 1 min. Add the tinned tomatoes. Fill the empty tin ¼ full with water; add that, too. Gently stir the browned meatballs into the tomato and fennel sauce. Season. This needs to simmer for 20 mins so start boiling the linguine after 12 mins. Boil a kettle. Fill a second saucepan with boiled water. Add a good pinch of salt. Heat to a boil on the hob. When the meatballs have about 8 mins left, boil the linguine for 7-8 mins, until just tender, then drain. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. Serve the linguine with the meatballs and sauce on top. Sprinkle over the cheese to finish.
