Warm salad of roasted Jerusalem artichokes and pears with blue cheese
Introduction:
A good, comforting salad of subtle contrasts – sweet pears, earthy Jerusalem artichokes, salty cheese and smoky bacon. This works fine without bacon for vegetarians, and it could also be made with beetroot instead of artichokes. 
Ingredients:
700-800g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed well (no need to peel them), each cut into 4 3 tbsp olive oil 2 firm pears, cut in ½ lengthways then into 6 wedges, stalks & core removed 1 tsp Dijon mustard juice of ½ a lemon 1 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar 3 tbsp olive oil 200g salad leaves or baby spinach 6 rashers of smoked bacon, fried or grilled until cooked, then cut into small pieces 150g blue cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Toss the artichokes in the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for 15 minutes, then add the pears and toss together. Roast for another 30 minutes or so, until the artichokes are cooked through and golden. While the artichokes are roasting, make the dressing: in a small bowl, whisk all the mustard, lemon juice, vinegar and oil together. Spread the salad leaves over a serving platter, scatter over the artichokes, pears and cooked bacon pieces, drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle over the crumbled blue cheese to serve.
