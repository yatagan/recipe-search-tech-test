Griddled purple sprouting broccoli and potato salad with mustard and walnut dressing
Introduction:
A slightly tangy vegetarian salad, hearty enough for a main course. If you don't have a griddle pan, fry off the potatoes in a frying pan, adding the purple sprouting broccoli to warm through before serving with the dressing. You can also make this with normal broccoli out of the purple sprouting season. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp crème fraîche juice of ¼ lemon handful toasted walnuts, roughly chopped ½ tsp coarse grain mustard 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 150-200g purple sprouting broccoli 2 large potatoes salt & pepper
Method:
To make the dressing, mix the crème fraîche, lemon juice, walnuts, mustard and parsley together in a small bowl and season to taste. Cook the purple sprouting broccoli in a pan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. Cook the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes, or until just tender, then drain and leave until cool enough to handle. Cut into wedges, leaving the skin on. Heat a griddle pan and toss the purple sprouting broccoli and potatoes in just enough oil to coat. Season, then griddle until griddle lines form on the veg. Serve tossed together in a large serving bowl, drizzled with the dressing.
