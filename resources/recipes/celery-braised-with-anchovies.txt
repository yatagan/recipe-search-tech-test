Celery braised with anchovies
Introduction:
Celery can be a centrepiece as well as a supplement to soups and salads. This simple, economical and flavoursome veggie recipe goes well with braised beef, pheasant or roast chicken. It’s also good with a handful of black olives thrown in. 
Ingredients:
60g butter 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, sliced 250g carrots, sliced 8 anchovies, mashed with a fork 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 4 celery hearts, tied with string if not compact 800ml beef stock 2 bay leaves 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Melt the butter and oil in a wide, shallow casserole, add the onion and carrots and cook over a low heat until slightly softened. Add the anchovies and vinegar and continue cooking for 3 minutes. Put the celery hearts on top of the other vegetables, pour in the beef stock, add the bay leaves and bring to the boil. Cover with greaseproof paper and a lid, then transfer to the oven. Cook for 20 minutes or until the celery is tender. Remove the celery and vegetables from the casserole and keep warm. Place the casserole back on the hob and rapidly boil the stock until reduced by half. Taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly. Pour the juices over the celery, sprinkle with the chopped parsley and serve.
