Steak, potato, broad bean and slow roasted tomato salad 
Introduction:
A great salad for the BBQ. 
Ingredients:
12 cherry tomatoes, halved 300g broad beans, podded weight 900g new or salad potatoes, scrubbed clean & cut into bite sized pieces 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp balsamic vinegar small handful fresh herbs e.g. chives, mint & basil, chopped 400g quick frying steak 1 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower small knob of butter
Method:
Preheat the oven to 140˚C/Gas 1. Place the tomatoes cut side up on a non-stick baking tray and drizzle with a little olive oil. Season and bake in the oven for 1½-2 hours, until softened and partly dried out. Remove and leave to cool. Cook the broad beans in boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain, refresh, then remove the outer skin to leave the inner green bean. Put in a bowl with the tomatoes. Boil the potatoes until just tender. Drain, cool, then add to the tomatoes and beans. Add the olive oil, vinegar, herbs and season well. Gently toss together. Next, heat a large frying pan. Drizzle the steak with a little oil and season. Once the pan is very hot, fry for a couple of minutes on each side, then add a little knob of butter. Remove the steak from the heat once the butter is melted and has started to foam. Leave the meat to rest for a good couple of minutes, then slice each steak, on the bias, into ribbons and serve on top of the potato salad.
