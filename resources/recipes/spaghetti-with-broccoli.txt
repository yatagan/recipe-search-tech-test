Spaghetti with broccoli
Introduction:
A clean, uncluttered pasta dish with anchovies, chilli and broccoli. This calls for very few ingredients – most from the store cupboard – and is ready in a trice: an ideal last-minute dinner. Add more or less chilli and anchovies according to taste. 
Ingredients:
90g dried spaghetti 100g broccoli, cut into small florets & thinly sliced stalks 1 tbsp olive oil ½ fresh red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped, or a few dried chilli flakes 1-2 anchovies, chopped 25g breadcrumbs (use stale bread) olive oil
Method:
Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Three minutes before it is ready, add the broccoli to the pan. Meanwhile heat the oil in a frying pan and add the chillies, anchovies and breadcrumbs. Fry until the breadcrumbs are golden. Drain the pasta and broccoli and toss in a bowl with ¾ of the breadcrumb mixture. Drizzle with a little olive oil and serve with the other ¼ of the breadcrumb mixture sprinkled on top.
