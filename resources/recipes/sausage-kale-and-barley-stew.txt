Sausage, kale and barley stew
Introduction:
Kale is an excellent companion to pork â€“ this stew is a prime example. Pearl barley adds a welcome bite and rosemary a lovely aromatic fragrance for a tasty, nutritious dinner. You can use a little chorizo if you've got it, or try pork chipolatas for a lesser meat option. Use winter greens in place of the kale, or leeks in place or onions. Any leftover reheats well. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 8 sausages 2 red or white onions, sliced 2 carrots, peeled & diced 240g pearl barley, rinsed with cold water 2 sprigs rosemary, leaves very finely chopped 1 litre chicken or veg stock 300g cavolo nero or other kale, leaves stripped from the stalks & roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan. Add the sausages and fry, turning now and then, until nicely browned all over. Remove the sausages to a plate and leave to one side. Add 1 tablespoon of more oil to the pan. Add the onion and carrot and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, stirring now and then, until softened. Add the barley, stir for a minute, then add the rosemary and stock. Season well. Simmer for 10 minutes, then return the sausages to the pan. Simmer for another 20 minutes. Add the chopped kale and simmer for another 5-10 minutes, until wilted. Check the seasoning before serving.
