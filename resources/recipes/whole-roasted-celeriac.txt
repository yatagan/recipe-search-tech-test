Whole roasted celeriac
Introduction:
Nothing could be easier than this technique for cooking celeriac: no chopping required. Serve this with lots of butter as a vegetarian centrepiece to a simple dinner with grains and greens, or as a side to roast meat. You can slice it like a loaf or cut it into wedges like a cake. 
Ingredients:
1 medium celeriac, about 1kg olive oil coarse sea salt few thyme sprigs few garlic cloves butter, to serve
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 5. Wash the celeriac well to remove any dirt (use a veg scrubber if you have one). Pat dry with kitchen paper or leave to air dry. Place on a large sheet of foil on a baking tray. Rub it all over with olive oil, sprinkle liberally with salt and add a few thyme sprigs and garlic cloves. Wrap the foil tightly around the celeriac to seal it. Roast for 2 hours, then unwrap the foil from the top and roast for a further 20-30 minutes, so the skin crisps up a little (large celeriac will take longer to cook). Squidge it a little - the celeriac should feel soft and tender inside. To serve, cut open and add a large knob of butter, like a giant jacket spud. Serve as it is at the table, for everyone to dig in and help themselves.
