Cordero Sevillanos
Introduction:
This Seville-inspired lamb stew is open to adaptation: any white beans or chickpeas will do; you don't need to be exact with your cooking times – only make sure you brown the lamb thoroughly; and you can stir in as large a handful (or two) of greens as you feel like – spinach, chard, kale and spring and winter greens. Eat with warm crusty bread to soak up the last of the juices. 
Ingredients:
1kg diced lamb zest & juice of 4 Seville oranges zest & juice of 1 lemon 1 tbsp seasoned flour olive oil 2 large onions, finely diced 3 garlic cloves, finely diced 1.25 litres chicken or lamb or veg stock handful of greens, finely chopped ½ tsp each ground allspice, cinnamon, coriander seed & a good pinch of ground cloves 2 tins chickpeas or butter beans (drained) 2 tbsp each mint & parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Marinade the lamb in the orange and lemon juice for a few hours or overnight. Drain, reserving the juice, and mix the lamb with the flour. Heat oil in a pan and fry the lamb in batches (brown thoroughly to avoid an anaemic-looking stew), then transfer to a casserole dish. Lower the heat and soften the onion and garlic for 10 minutes. Transfer them to the casserole, deglaze the pan with stock and pour into the casserole. Add the reserved juice. Cook gently for 1 hour 30 minutes, then add the remaining ingredients and zest (apart from the mint and parsley). Cook for another hour, season and sprinkle with parsley to serve.
