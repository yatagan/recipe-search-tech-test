Slow-cooked courgettes
Introduction:
Your are always told not to overcook vegetables, but here's an exception. This can be piled on toast, whizzed into soup, scooped over brown rice or eaten as a side with salmon or roast chicken. It also works really well at room temperature as part of a mezze spread. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 4 courgettes, cut into 2 cm chunks 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 tsp coriander seeds, coarsely crushed juice of Â½ lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a saucepan over a moderate heat, then tip in the courgettes, garlic and coriander seeds and season lightly with salt and pepper. Lower heat, cover and cook gently for 20-30 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and mash the courgettes roughly with a fork, and then season to taste with lemon juice and more salt and pepper. Drizzle in a few more drops of oil, if you like. Serve hot with simply grilled fish or cold as part of a buffet.
