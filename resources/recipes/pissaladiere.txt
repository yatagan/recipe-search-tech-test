Pissaladière
Introduction:
This wonderful combination of sweet caramelised onions offset by salty anchovies and olives is something only the French could have come up with. It's what the inhabitants of Provence have instead of pizza and is good for a starter or light lunch. Sliced tomatoes, brushed with a little oil, could be added with the anchovies. If you'd like to make this vegetarian, exchange anchovies for capers to keep that hint of salt. 
Ingredients:
175g plain flour 1 tsp caster sugar pinch salt 125g cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes about 3 tbsp cold water 2 tbsp olive oil 4 large onions, finely sliced 6 anchovy fillets, cut in half lengthways 10 black olives, stoned
Method:
First make the pastry. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and process briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl and stir in enough water to make a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the onions, then cover and cook gently for about 45 minutes, until soft. Season to taste. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface into a rough 25cm square. Place on a baking sheet, prick with a fork and chill for 10 minutes. Spread the onions thickly over the pastry base. Crisscross with the anchovies (or you can write your name in them, if you like) and dot with the olives. Bake for 20 minutes.
