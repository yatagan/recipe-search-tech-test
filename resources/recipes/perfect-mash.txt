Perfect mash
Introduction:
For the very best results, the potatoes should be boiled in their skins and peeled while still hot. By all means try it, but it's time consuming and messy. You can still get excellent results by following the method below. Stir in a spoonful of wholegrain mustard at the end for a peppier taste. For just a few of the many wonderful ways to use up leftover mash, try bubble and squeak, beetroot bubble and squeak or colcannon. 
Ingredients:
1kg floury potatoes, such as Cosmos, Sante, Cara or Maris Piper, peeled & cut into chunks 100ml milk 100ml double cream 100g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until tender. Drain well in a colander and leave for a few minutes for excess water to drain off. Heat the milk, cream and butter in a large pan just until the butter has melted. Pass the potatoes through a mouli-l√©gumes or a potato ricer into the hot cream and then beat well. Season to taste.
