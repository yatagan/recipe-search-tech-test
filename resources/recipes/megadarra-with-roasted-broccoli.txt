Megadarra with roasted broccoli 
Introduction:
Simple, fragrant, exotic and cheap, this is a Middle Eastern dish comprised simply of lentils, rice, and onions, with doses of olive oil and salt for good measure. Apart from the addition of roasted broccoli, it's made from the store cupboard – so great for last minute cooking. It's traditionally eaten both warm and at room temperature. 
Ingredients:
250g Puy (speckled) lentils, rinsed well & drained 800ml veg stock or water 250g brown basmati rice, rinsed well & drained 1 heaped tsp ground allspice 1 heaped tsp ground cumin 4 tbsp olive oil 2 large onions, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 large head broccoli, cut into florets pinch dried chilli flakes plain yoghurt, to serve
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Put the lentils in a pan with the stock or water. Bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the rice, allspice and cumin. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the rice and lentils are cooked and the liquid absorbed (keep an eye on the liquid, adding a little more if it’s boiling dry). Season. While the lentils and rice are cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan. Add the onions and fry on a very low heat for 25 minutes, stirring now and then to stop the onions from catching, until golden. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes. Also while the lentils are cooking, toss the broccoli in a baking dish with 2 tablespoons of oil. Season and sprinkle with chilli. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until just tender and crisping. Stir ¾ of the onions into the lentil and rice mixture. Serve with the rest of the onions and the broccoli on top, with a good dollop of yoghurt.
