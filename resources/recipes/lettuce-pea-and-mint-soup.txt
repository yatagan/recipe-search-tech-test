Lettuce, pea and mint soup
Introduction:
A good soup for a summer's day: bright, green and not too filling. Good for Saturday lunch, alongside wedges of cheddar, oatcakes etc. This is fine with frozen peas too.
Ingredients:
large round lettuce, about 400g 25g butter 2 or 3 shallots, thinly sliced 500g shelled peas 1 litre chicken or veg stock (or water) 3 bushy sprigs of mint salt & pepper
Method:
Separate the lettuce leaves and stalks and wash thoroughly. Melt the butter in a deep saucepan over a low to moderate heat, then soften the shallots in the butter. When they are tender but have yet to colour, chop the lettuce up a bit and stir it into the butter. When it has wilted, tip in the peas, stock and mint leaves and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down, season with salt and black pepper and simmer for 7-10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and blend the soup in a liquidiser. Check the seasoning, then serve hot.
