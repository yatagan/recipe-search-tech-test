Spanish crisp cauliflower
Introduction:
This is well worth the effort! If you can't find gram (chickpea) flour, you can use plain white flour, though it won't have the same nutty flavour. Don't be put off by deep frying; half an inch of oil in a heavy frying pan will work too, so long as you turn the pieces during cooking. This is good served as a snack with drinks or with a dressed salad as a starter. 
Ingredients:
½ cauliflower, broken into small florets 2 tbsp gram flour (available from Indian shops & large supermarkets) 1 tsp paprika sunflower oil for deep frying 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tbsp capers, rinsed & chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the cauliflower florets in boiling salted water for a few minutes, until just tender. Drain well and, while it is still hot, put in a bowl with the flour, paprika and some salt and pepper. Mix it all together until the cauliflower is coated with flour. Heat the sunflower oil to 190°C/Gas 5 in a deep-fat fryer or a deep, heavy-based saucepan. Fry the cauliflower florets in batches until crisp and golden, then remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper. Sprinkle with the vinegar, chopped capers and parsley and serve.
