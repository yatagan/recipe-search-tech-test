Mushroom and leek pasta
Introduction:
This pasta recipe has many variations. You could cook the leeks long and low, until caramelised, for a greater depth of flavour. To make it vegetarian, substitute the Parmesan. Or for vegans, leave out the Parmesan and crème fraîche completely – it'll still be rich and delicious. If you don't have fettuccine, any other type of pasta will do – or scoop the sauce over a pile of grains instead. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp fresh oregano leaves, or ½ tsp dried oregano or mixed herbs 2 leeks, cleaned & finely sliced 200g mushrooms, cleaned 400g fettuccine (or any other pasta) zest of 1 lemon 70g Parmesan, grated 30g fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped(optional) 2 tbsp créme fraîche(optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil for the pasta. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and then add the garlic, oregano, leeks and mushrooms. Sauté for a few minutes until the leeks and mushrooms have softened, then season. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, drain and return it to the warm pan. Add the grated lemon zest, Parmesan and parsley if using, stirring them into the pasta. Finish with crème fraîche, if using. Season then serve with extra grated Parmesan.
