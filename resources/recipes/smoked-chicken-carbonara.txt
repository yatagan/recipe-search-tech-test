Smoked chicken carbonara
Introduction:
The smokeyness in the chicken is an excellent replacement for smoked bacon, usually used in carbonara. 
Ingredients:
200g smoked chicken breast 150g Parmesan, Pecorino or mixture of both 3 large eggs 400g pasta 2 garlic cloves, left whole 50g unsalted butter salt & pepper
Method:
Put a large saucepan of salted water on to boil. Finely chop the smoked chicken. Grate the cheese(s). Beat the eggs in a bowl, season with a little freshly ground black pepper and set everything aside. Cook the pasta in the boiling water. Meanwhile squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. Melt the butter in a large wide frying pan and gently fry the garlic for a couple of minutes. Add the smoked chicken and cook, stirring frequently for another 3-4 minutes. The garlic will have done its business so take it out with a slotted spoon and bin. Keep the heat under the chicken on low. When the pasta is done, drain and transfer to the chicken pan. Keep a little of the pasta water. Mix three quarters of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for serving. Take the pan of spaghetti and smoked chicken off the heat and pour in the eggs and cheese and, using tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes with the egg mixture, which should thicken but not scramble. When the pasta is well coated add a little extra pasta cooking water to keep it sauce-like. You donâ€™t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt. Serve with the extra cheese.
