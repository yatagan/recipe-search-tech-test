Turkey meatball broth with greens 
Introduction:
This festive dish is also known as minestra marita (wedding soup) for its perfect marriage of succulent, herby meatballs and tender greens. In place of or as well as cabbage you can use kale, spinach, escarole or chard. If you’d like to bulk it up more, add in a handful of orzo or other small pasta shape, or a well-rinsed and drained tin of white beans. 
Ingredients:
50g white bread, blitzed into crumbs 1 tbsp milk 250g cooked turkey, finely chopped or lightly blitzed in a food processor 1-2 egg yolks 1 tbsp fresh sage, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or light olive 1 large or 2 small onions, finely diced 1 large carrot, peeled & finely diced 1 celery stick, finely diced 300g shredded green cabbage, e.g. Savoy or January King 1 litre chicken stock small handful Parmesan, finely grated salt & pepper
Method:
In a large bowl, stir the breadcrumbs into the milk. Add the turkey, egg yolk, sage and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and use your hands to mix and squidge it together well. Make sure it sticks together; add a little more egg yolk and/or soaked breadcrumbs if needed. Roll into walnut-sized balls. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large, deep frying pan and fry the meatballs to lightly brown them all over (cook in batches if they don’t all fit). Transfer to a plate. Add the onion, carrot and celery to the same pan and cook for 15–20 minutes on a low heat, until tender but not coloured, stirring now and then. If the veg looks like catching at any point, add a splash of water. Add the meatballs, cabbage and stock. Simmer for 5–6 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through (cut one open if you’re not sure) and the cabbage wilted. Check the seasoning and serve sprinkled with the Parmesan.
