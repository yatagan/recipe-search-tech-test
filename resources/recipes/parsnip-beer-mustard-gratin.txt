Parsnip and beer mustard gratin
Introduction:
This easily made, creamy gratin is a good weeknight dinner on its own with just a green salad and crusty bread. It's also a lovely accompaniment to pork – be it roast, chops or sausages. You could add in some fried bacon lardons, or substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese to keep this vegetarian. If you don't have beer mustard, any other wholegrain mustard will do – add a small pinch of chilli to get the equivalent effect. 
Ingredients:
butter for greasing 300ml milk 250ml cream 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves pinch nutmeg, grated 800g parsnips, peeled & sliced into thin rounds 2 tbsp beer mustard small handful dried breadcrumbs small handful Parmesan, grated (or Cheddar if vegetarian) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Lightly grease a medium sized gratin or baking dish with a little butter. Put the milk, cream, garlic and thyme leaves in a pan. Grate in a little fresh nutmeg, then warm gently. Layer the parsnips in the baking dish. Stir the mustard into the warm milk mixture. Season, then pour over the parsnips. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour. Uncover, sprinkle over the cheese and breadcrumbs, then bake for approx 15 minutes until golden.
