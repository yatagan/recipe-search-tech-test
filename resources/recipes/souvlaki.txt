Souvlaki
Introduction:
Serve these kebabs or pork and veg with some warm pitta bread and tzatziki. Chose veg that either cook quickly or you don’t mind a little al dente; cremating the meat to wait for the vegetables is not what you want, and a 2cm cube of pork doesn't take long to cook. 100g of pork should be plenty for each kebab. 
Ingredients:
200g pork, in 2cm dice juice of 1 lemon oregano 400g assorted veg – try peppers, courgettes, onions salt & pepper
Method:
Marinate the pork in the lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper for an hour. Thread onto kebab sticks (pre-soaked in water for 30 minutes if you are using wood) with the vegetables. Don’t push too much onto the kebab sticks though– the heat from the barbecue needs to be able get to all surfaces. Barbecue, griddle or grill for about 8-10 minutes, turning regularly, or until the meat is cooked through.
