Onion borek
Introduction:
Although there's a long salting time, this Turkish-style pastry is very easy to make. You could also cook the onions in a little oil (but no salt) rather than salting them – in which case you'll need to use slightly more than the recipe allows. 
Ingredients:
½ tbsp salt 250g onions, thinly sliced ¼ tsp dried mint ¼ tsp hot chilli powder 25ml tahini paste 1 tbsp walnuts, chopped 250g readymade puff pastry, defrosted salt & pepper
Method:
In a bowl, mix the salt and sliced onions together. Cover and leave for 6-8 hours. Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Squeeze out the onions and drain off the excess liquid. Mix with the mint, chilli, tahini, walnuts and season with black pepper. On a floured surface, cut the puff pastry into 4 pieces and roll out each piece to about 15x15cm. Place a spoon of the onion mixture on the middle of the pastry. Wet the edges with water and fold the pastry over to make a triangle shape. Press down to seal. Place all the parcels on a lightly greased baking tray and bake for about 15 minutes, until golden and risen.
