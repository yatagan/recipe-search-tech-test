Wild garlic & purple sprouting broccoli ragout
Introduction:
A coconut broth is used to cook nutty tasting wild rice and quinoa, with a seasonal pairing of wild garlic and purple sprouting broccoli: two of our favourite homegrown spring vegetables.
Ingredients:
1 onion 50g red quinoa 50g wild rice 200g purple sprouting broccoli 1 tbsp garam masala ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes – add to taste 1 tsp bouillon powder 20g flaked almonds 15g parsley 50g wild garlic ½ tin chickpeas 1 tin coconut milk 20g toasted coconut chips
Method:
Peel and finely slice the onion. Gently fry for 10 mins, stirring now and then. Rinse the quinoa and wild rice (separately) in a sieve. Trim the broccoli. Using it all - stalks, florets and leaves - split any large pieces down so they’re roughly 5-6cm pieces. Add ½ the garam masala and all or just a pinch of chilli flakes (to your taste for heat) to the onion. Add the wild rice, bouillon powder and 400ml water. Season, stir and simmer for 25 mins. Keep an eye on the liquid and top up with a little extra water if needed. Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan, stirring often, until lightly golden. Transfer to a plate. Roughly chop the parsley leaves. Shred the wild garlic leaves. Drain the chickpeas. After 25 mins, add the quinoa and coconut milk to the rice pan. Simmer for 10 mins. Keep an eye on the liquid level as it cooks from now on - you don’t want it too brothy, but add a splash of water if it looks like it’s getting too thick. Add the broccoli, wild garlic and ½ the drained chickpeas (keep the rest in the fridge). Taste and add more garam masala if you like. Cook for a further 8 mins or so, until the broccoli is tender and quinoa and rice are cooked - N.B. wild rice retains some bite when cooked. When ready, check the seasoning. Stir in the parsley and sprinkle over the almonds and coconut chips to serve.
