Country pâté
Introduction:
At Riverford we've been making a version of this simple country pâté since day one. The beauty of a it is that nothing is cast in stone. Variations are endless; as well as changing the meat (diced chicken or game can be good), a few nuts or dried fruit can give it a bit of a lift. Serve at room temperature with a sprinkling of salt, crisp cornichons and some toasted country bread or baguette. 
Ingredients:
100g onion, finely chopped 25g garlic, finely chopped knob of butter 1 tsp quatre épices pinch of thyme splash of brandy 2 tbsp flour 200g streaky bacon 400g minced pork 200g minced bacon 200g pig or chicken liver
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Soften the onion and garlic in the butter, herbs, brandy and flour. Line a dish with foil (if you don't have a suitable dish, this lot will fit into a large Chinese takeaway foil). Line the foiled dish with slices of bacon, flattened and thinned with the back of a knife. Mix together the onion, garlic and meat and fill the container, folding over the tops of the bacon slices to form a lid. Cover with kitchen foil and place in a roasting tray half filled with water. Cook for about 2 hours, then press lightly - a 1kg bag of sugar wrapped in a plastic bag works well - for a couple of hours until cool.
