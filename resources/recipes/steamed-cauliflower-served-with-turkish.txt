Steamed cauliflower served with Turkish tarator sauce
Introduction:
Turkish tarator sauce is a lovely, nutty, garlic and bread sauce that's traditionally eaten with mussels and fried fish as well as veg. It compliments the mild nuttiness of cauliflower, but is equally good with other lightly cooked vegetables, like green beans. You can experiment with the nuts â€“ almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts are all commonly used. This will keep for a few days in a jam jar in the fridge. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, cut into florets 2 slices thin bread, crusts removed 100g walnuts or hazelnuts, ground 140ml olive oil 2-3 tbsp wine vinegar 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the cauliflower florets in salted water until just tender. Drain and allow to dry. Dip the bread in water and squeeze dry. Crumble the bread and add it to the ground walnuts. Gradually add the oil, beating constantly. Stir in the vinegar, garlic and season. The sauce should be smooth and creamy. This sauce can be made using an electric blender. Drizzle the sauce over the cauliflower.
