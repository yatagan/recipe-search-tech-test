Poached eggs with Portobello mushrooms
Introduction:
Portabello mushrooms make an excellent vehicle for creamy poached eggs. Eat with a pile of just-wilted spinach for a bread-free vegetarian breakfast or a quick dinner. Use the very best eggs you can for this â€“ you'll really taste the difference. If you've got time, try this with roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine. 
Ingredients:
4 Portobello mushrooms, cleaned olive oil 2 eggs dash white wine vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Place the mushrooms skin side down on a grilling tray. Brush with a little olive oil and season. Place under a medium grill for about 7-10 minutes, turning once, until cooked. While the mushrooms are cooking, bring a pan of water to the boil. Add a little vinegar to the water. Crack the eggs into two cups. Stir the water until it looks like a whirlpool. Turn the heat down so the water is simmering not boiling. Gently add the eggs one by one to the circling water. Cook for 3 minutes at a simmer. Remove from the pan and season with salt and pepper. Serve with the mushrooms.
