Radicchio pasta
Introduction:
Smoky bacon pairs with pleasantly bitter radicchio for a quick and flavoursome pasta dish. Prepare the sauce while the pasta cooks and they'll both be ready at the same time. You could add some torn sage to the bacon and cook for two minute before adding radicchio. This is also good with the addition either of mushrooms or of a little gorgonzola. If you find the sauce too bitter when you taste it at the end add more cream and Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
400g pasta - linguine, fettuccine or ideally pappardelle if you can get it 1 large onion, finely sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 25g butter 250g smoked streaky bacon, rind removed, or prosciutto, chopped into 10cm strips 150g radicchio, washed & shredded 50ml cream juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Fry onion in oil and butter until translucent in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Add bacon and fry until starting to colour. Add radicchio, stir and cook until collapsed, adding a little more oil if necessary. Meanwhile cook pasta. When pasta is almost done add cream and lemon juice to sauce. Season to taste, add Parmesan and toss with pasta. Serve topped with chopped parsley if you have it.
