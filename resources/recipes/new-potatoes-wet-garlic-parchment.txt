New potatoes and wet garlic in parchment
Introduction:
This is a classic Field Kitchen dish, served when new potatoes and wet garlic come into season. 'En papilotte' is the French for food baked in parchment. This nifty technique seals in the herb flavours and lets the food cook in its own moisture. These new potatoes are a good accompaniment to a dinner of white fish or salmon. Omit the wet garlic if it is unavailable. 
Ingredients:
800g new potatoes, scrubbed & cut in ½ or ⅓ if large 1 small handful shredded wet garlic 4 sprigs thyme 3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Take a large piece of baking parchment (about 40x60cm) and put it on a large roasting tray. Toss all the ingredients in a large bowl, then pile up in the middle of the parchment. Fold the paper over and roll the edges up tightly all around to seal it. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove and serve the whole thing at the table, breaking open the puffed up parchment.
