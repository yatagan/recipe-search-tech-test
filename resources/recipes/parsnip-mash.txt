Parsnip mash
Introduction:
This is a simple, warming mash that can be eaten as is, or adapted any which way. Parsnips go well with Indian spices, so you could add any or all of cumin, curry powder and coriander instead of nutmeg. If you prefer your mash to be less sweet, use half parsnips and half potatoes, celeriac or swede. Or add any carrots lurking in the bottom of the fridge. 
Ingredients:
1kg parsnips, peeled & cut into chunks 25g butter nutmeg, grated, to taste splash milk (or cream) salt & pepper flaked almonds (optional)
Method:
In a pan of boiling water, cook the parsnips until just tender (about 10-12 minutes). Drain, return to the pan. Add the butter, milk or cream and grated nutmeg. Mash well. Season to taste and scatter over almonds (if using).
