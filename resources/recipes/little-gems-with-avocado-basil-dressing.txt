Little Gems with avocado and basil dressing
Introduction:
This is a simple and delectable vegetarian starter or side dish. Only make it if you have a very ripe avocado or you won't get the velvety, unctuous sauce that sets off the Little Gems so well. This is good with the addition of peas or broad beans, mint, crumbled feta. It pairs well with pork or beef steaks, or with fried halloumi. 
Ingredients:
2 little gems, cut into wedges with root intact olive oil for the dressing: 1 very ripe avocado small handful fresh basil leaves 1 garlic clove, crushed 4 tbsp olive oil juice of ½ lemon, more to taste a few drops tabasco sauce fresh chilli, chopped(optional), to taste salt & pepper
Method:
For the dressing, put all the ingredients in a food processor or blender with 4-5 tablespoons cold water (or more if you want the dressing thinner), and purée until smooth. Season and taste before serving, adding more lemon juice and some finely chopped fresh chilli if you like. Toss the little gems in just enough olive oil to lightly coat (about 2 tablespoons), season then griddle or gently wilt on a low to medium heat in a large frying pan until just wilted. Drizzle over the dressing to serve.
