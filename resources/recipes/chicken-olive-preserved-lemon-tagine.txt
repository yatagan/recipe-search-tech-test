Chicken, olive and preserved lemon tagine
Introduction:
A succulent, subtly flavoured Moroccan chicken tagine with olives and preserved lemon. This is best cooked in a wide, shallow dish with a lid if you don't have a tagine. Serve it with flatbread to mop up the juices, and/or a dish of couscous mixed with toasted flaked almonds, chopped parsley or coriander, lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil 4 chicken legs (or large, bone-in thighs) 1 onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 2 tbsp clear honey pinch saffron threads (optional) 150g pitted olives (green or black) 1 preserved lemon, rinsed well, flesh removed & rind finely sliced or chopped 200ml stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat half the oil in a large heavy-based casserole dish or flameproof tagine. Brown the chicken on both sides and remove to a plate. Gently fry the onion in the rest of the oil for a few minutes to soften without colouring. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another 2 minutes. Stir in the honey, saffron threads, olives and preserved lemon rind. Return the chicken to the pan and pour over the stock. Season and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover and gently simmer for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
