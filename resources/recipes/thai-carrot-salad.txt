Thai carrot salad
Introduction:
A refreshing sweet and sour salad. This goes well with fishcakes, grilled salmon or chicken. It's also flavourful enough to be enjoyed with just a plate of brown rice. If you'd like to make this vegetarian, try using a little soy sauce or miso in place of the fish sauce. 
Ingredients:
1Â½ tbsp caster sugar juice of 2 limes 1-2 tbsp Thai fish sauce 1-2 small hot chillies, deseeded if you don't like things hot, & finely shredded 500g carrots, coarsely grated 2 spring onions, finely sliced, including the green 2 handfuls coriander leaves 100g salted peanuts, crushed (optional)
Method:
Make the dressing: Dissolve the sugar in the lime juice. Add the fish sauce and chillies, bit by bit, tasting as you go until you have a good balance of hot, salty and sweet. Feel free to alter the proportions if you like. Mix dressing into the carrots, add the spring onion and coriander and serve scattered with crushed peanuts if using.
