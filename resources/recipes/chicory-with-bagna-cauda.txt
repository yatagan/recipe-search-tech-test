Chicory with bagna cauda
Introduction:
Literally meaning 'hot bath', this anchovy and garlic sauce is traditionally served in Northern Italy with crudit√©s and good bread for dipping. As well as chicory, try dipping any other crunchy veg you fancy. It's also delicious drizzled over steamed broccoli. 
Ingredients:
8 garlic cloves 200ml milk 10 anchovy fillets (preferably salted) 100g softened butter olive oil, for drizzling chicory leaves
Method:
Put the garlic cloves in a small pan, cover with the milk and simmer for about 40 minutes until the garlic is soft. Pour the entire contents of the pan into a food processor, add the anchovy fillets and process until smooth. Slowly add the softened butter and then drizzle in olive oil to taste. You should have a sloppy, emulsified sauce. Sometimes it has a tendency to separate; you can bring it back together by warming it gently while whisking. Serve with the chicory leaves.
