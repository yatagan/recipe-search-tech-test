Tomato, garlic and herb dressing 
Introduction:
This is a lovely quick dressing that can also be made with a tin of tomatoes. It's good for pepping up veg dishes from boiled new potatoes to braised greens or salad and can also be scooped over a bowl of grains. Add a handful of fresh, chopped herbs after cooking if you've got them around – basil, parsley and coriander all work well. 
Ingredients:
100 ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 4 tomatoes, skinned, deseeded, cored & flesh diced 1 tbsp fresh basil, chopped 1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar ¼ tsp cayenne pepper mozzarella (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 100ml olive oil on a low heat in a pan. Add the garlic and fry for a few minutes, then add the tomatoes for another 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the basil, balsamic or sherry vinegar and the cayenne pepper. Season and add some mozzarella if you like.
