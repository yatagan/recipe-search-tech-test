Parsnip, coconut, lime and ginger cake
Introduction:
A light, easy-to-make, dairy-free cake. Grated parsnips add a wonderful moistness and lime zest and coconut an unusual, delicate freshness. Let cool before slicing. 
Ingredients:
2 large eggs 100g soft light brown sugar 75ml sunflower oil, plus a little extra for greasing 250g parsnips, peeled & grated 100g self-raising flour 3 balls stem ginger, finely chopped 1 tsp ground ginger 50g dessicated coconut 75g pecan nuts, roughly chopped zest of 1 lime
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Grease an 18cm round cake tin with a little oil on a piece of kitchen paper. Line it with baking parchment. Put the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and beat until thick and creamy (a hand held mixer really helps). Gradually whisk in the oil. Fold in the rest of the ingredients. Transfer the mixture to the tin and level it gently with your wooden spoon. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin.
