Tarka dal with spring greens
Introduction:
A quick dal with added greens - great for a midweek supper. If you have more time, you could add a little more water and cook the mung for longer so they mash down and turn really creamy. 
Ingredients:
125g yellow mung dal (or use red lentils), rinsed well oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 small onion, finely sliced 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 2-3cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated ½ tsp turmeric 1 chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 200g spring greens, rib stalks cut out small handful fresh coriander leaves lemon juice to taste for the tarka: 2 tbsp oil 2 tsp black mustard seeds 2 garlic cloves, very finely sliced ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 tsp cumin seeds
Method:
Put the mung in a large heatproof bowl, pour over 600ml boiling water and leave to soak. Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a large heavy-based saucepan and fry the onion gently for 10 minutes, until soft and translucent, then add the garlic, ginger, turmeric and chilli. Cook for another couple of minutes. Skim any scum from the top of the mung, then add them and the soaking liquid to the onion. Bring to the boil, then simmer for about 20 minutes, until the mung are cooked through and soft. You can mash them lightly if you like, for a creamier texture. While the mung are cooking, boil the spring greens for 6-8 minutes until tender. Drain and refresh in very cold water, then drain and squeeze out any liquid. Finely shred the leaves. To make the tarka, gently heat the oil. Add the mustard seeds, garlic, chilli and cumin. Fry, stirring constantly, for a minute or two, until the mustard seeds pop. While the tarka is heating up, stir the spring greens into the mung to warm through, then add the coriander and lemon juice, and serve, drizzled with the tarka.
