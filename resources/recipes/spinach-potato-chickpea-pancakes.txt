Spinach, potato & chickpea pancakes
Introduction:
Chickpea pancakes have many incarnations, including Italian socca and Indian dosa. They are naturally dairy and gluten-free, and high in protein. Serve with a good dollop of yoghurt (dairy or non-dairy), some fruity chutney and wedges of lemon for squeezing. 
Ingredients:
1 baking-sized potato, peeled & cut into 2cm dice oil for frying 1 onion, peeled & finely sliced 1 garlic clove, peeled & finely chopped 1 tin chickpeas, drained & roughly chopped 1-2 tablespoons ready-made curry paste (use your favourite, hot or mild!) 150g chickpea flour 1 teaspoon black onion seeds 300g spinach, washed well, leaves stripped from their stalks salt & pepper
Method:
Put the potato in a pan of salted water. Bring to the boil and cook for 5-6 mins, until just tender, then drain into a sieve. Heat 1 tbsp oil in the saucepan you cooked the potatoes in. Add the onion. Reduce to a low heat. Cook for approx. 5 mins, until softened. Add the potato, garlic, chickpeas, curry paste and 2 tablespoons of water. Stir over a medium heat for approx. 2 mins, until fully coated in the curry paste. Simmer over a low heat while you make the pancakes. Sift the chickpea flour into a bowl. Add 220ml water and the black onion seeds. Whisk to combine, then season. Grease a frying pan with a little oil. Add a ladle of batter to the frying pan. Cook the pancake for approx. 1-2 mins, until small bubbles begin to form on the surface. Carefully turn over and repeat on the other side, until golden brown. Repeat until you have 4 pancakes. Add the spinach to the potato, a handful at a time. Stir for approx. 3-4 mins, until wilted. Divide the pancakes between two plates. Fill with the spiced potato mixture and serve.
