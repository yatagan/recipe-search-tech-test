Raspberry and cinnamon muffins
Introduction:
Masses of sweet, fresh raspberries make these dairy-free muffins deliciously moist. They’ll keep in an airtight container for a few days, making a lovely teatime or packed lunch treat. You can also tone down the sugar slightly (or not!) and eat them from breakfast. They freeze well. 
Ingredients:
150ml sunflower oil 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 200ml cold water 225g self-raising flour 75g porridge oats 175g light brown sugar 50g ground almonds ½ tsp ground cinnamon 250g raspberries
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 7 and line a tin with large paper muffin cases. Put the oil and vinegar in a bowl and add 200ml cold water. In another bowl, combine the flour, oats, sugar, almonds and cinnamon. Tip into the oil/vinegar mixture and stir until just combined (over-mixing makes the muffins tough). Gently stir in the raspberries and fill the muffin cases evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until cooked through and golden on top.
