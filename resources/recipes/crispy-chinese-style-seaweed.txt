Crispy Chinese-style seaweed
Introduction:
The popular Chinese dish of crispy seaweed is actually really spring greens. Cooked this way they're salty and moreish. This goes well with a simple stir-fry and can be finished with toasted sesame seeds, Chinese five-spice powder, chilli or simply eaten as is. 
Ingredients:
500ml vegetable oil 1 big pile of summer greens, finely sliced 1 tsp salt 1 tbsp sugar a splash of soy sauce
Method:
In a wok or heavy saucepan (or deep fat fryer, if you have one), heat the oil until sizzling. Fry the greens in batches until shrivelled and crisp (this takes far longer than expected), then drain on kitchen paper. Toss with the salt, sugar and soy.
