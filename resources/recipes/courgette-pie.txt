Courgette pie
Introduction:
A savoury summer pie filled with courgettes, ricotta and provolone cheese and seasoned with garlic and basil. Use shop-bought rather than homemade shortcrust if you'd like to cut down preparation time. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. A big green salad and a glass of white wine go down very well as accompaniments. 
Ingredients:
for the pastry: 350g plain flour 2 tsp caster sugar large pinch salt 250g cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes for the filling: 600g courgettes, grated 150g provolone cheese 125g ricotta cheese 4 eggs 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp fresh basil, chopped pinch nutmeg salt & pepper
Method:
To make the pastry: Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and process briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl and stir in enough water to make a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes or more. Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Grease a 9 inch pie dish. Make the filling while the pastry is chilling. In a large bowl add the courgettes and season with salt. Leave to drain in a colander for 30 minutes. Squeeze the courgettes to drain any remaining liquid. Return the courgettes to the bowl and add the provolone, ricotta, 3 beaten eggs, garlic, basil and nutmeg. Season and combine the ingredients. Roll out about ½-⅔ of the pastry, enough to line the base and sides of the pie dish. Spoon the courgette mixture into the dish and level with a spatula or spoon. Brush the rim of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll out enough remaining pastry to make a lid. Press over the top and press the edges together. Trim the edge and crimp together with your thumb and finger. Prick the top of the pie and brush with beaten egg. Place the pie on a baking dish and cook for 50 minutes until the pastry is golden.
