Easy ideas for salsify and scorzonera 
Introduction:
They both look like long, thin parsnips (or giants' pencils) and have a tender and delicate flavour. Salsify is paler and sweeter, scorzena is darker and crisper, but they can be used in the same way in cooking. 
Ingredients:
Salsify or scorzonera
Method:
Boiled or steamed: Cut into chunks, boil in salted water until tender, rinse under cold water and peel. Then melt a good slice of butter with about 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan. Gently fry a couple of crushed cloves of garlic in the mixture. Add the salsify, toss in the garlic mix and sprinkle with LOTS of parsley. Toss once cooked in a little cream or crème fraiche with a small amount of nutmeg. Roasted: Toss the raw chunks in a little olive oil, season with a tablespoon of chopped thyme and roast for about half an hour in the oven at about 190°C/Gas 5. Roast them mixed with other root vegetables by cutting into wedges, tossing in a little oil, sprinkling with thyme and balsamic vinegar. Salads: Cook in chunks until just tender and then dress while warm (not hot). Use either a fairly sharp vinaigrette (maybe 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar, 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil, ½ tbsp Dijon mustard, a pinch of caster sugar, salt and pepper), or a dressing made by combining half a finely chopped onion, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and a couple of pinches of caster sugar. Whisk these together and then continue whisking while you add 3 tablespoon of olive oil and 3 tablespoon of sunflower oil in a very thin stream. Lots of chopped parsley is a good addition. To make the salsify go further or make more of a meal, combine with mild salad leaves, beans (green, or cannellini or flageolet), leeks, chicken or eggs. Basically these roots combine best with mild flavours.
