Spinach baked with double cream and Parmesan
Introduction:
This is a simple and heavenly dish. Make it as a side to roasts, chops or fish. Or have it as a weeknight dinner with a poached egg and torn off pieces of crusty bread to soak up the creamy juices. You can add another cheese in place of Parmesan if you're vegetarian – a slightly smoky Swiss cheese would be good. Or sprinkle over some breadcrumbs before baking for a bit of crunch. 
Ingredients:
200g spinach (or chard) 1 egg, beaten 200ml double cream 1 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Cook the spinach by gently wilting it in a pan with a little butter for about 5 minutes. Chop it into smallish strips, then mix it in with the beaten egg, Parmesan and season to taste. Bake in a gratin dish or pastry case for about 25 minutes, until just set.
