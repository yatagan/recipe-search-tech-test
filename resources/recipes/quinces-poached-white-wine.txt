Quinces poached in white wine
Introduction:
The spices echo the fruit’s own fragrance, but aren’t essential; you could simply use the wine and sugar. These are ideal served as part of a dessert or used in a savoury context, alongside some roast pork or salty cheddar.
Ingredients:
1 bottle white wine 100g sugar 1 cinnamon stick 1 star anise 1 bay leaf 2 quinces (about 700g)
Method:
Tip the wine into a deep saucepan and add the sugar and spices. Peel the quinces and cut each one into 8 equal wedges. Remove the tough core and seeds with a simple v-shaped cut. Add the wedges straight into the pan and sit the skin peelings on top – they add to the flavour but also help to keep the fruit submerged in the liquid. Bring to a simmer and poach gently for about 40 mins, or until tender to the tip of a knife. Allow to cool in the liquid. Drain away and reserve the liquid. Discard the peelings and spices. Store the quinces covered in the liquid.
