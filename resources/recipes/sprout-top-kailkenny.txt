Sprout top Kailkenny (Colcannon) 
Introduction:
The name varies depending where you come from! You could use spring greens, cabbage or kale instead of sprout tops. If you're short on time, leave out the baking part.
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped 50g butter 75ml milk 1 head sprout tops, stalks removed, leaves shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ÂºC/Gas Mark 4. Cook the potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water and cook until tender. Drain, mash with the butter and milk, season. While the potatoes are cooking, steam or boil the cabbage until just tender. Drain, refresh in cold water, then drain again. Mix with the mash and transfer to a greased baking dish.
