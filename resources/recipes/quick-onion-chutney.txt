Quick onion chutney
Introduction:
This very simple chutney goes well with strong Cheddar, with a ploughman's sandwich lunch, or with a dinner of sausages and mash or lamb with spinach and lentils. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 2 onions, sliced ½ bulb wet garlic, thinly sliced, or 1 clove dried (normal) garlic, crushed or finely chopped 1 tbsp demerara or other light brown sugar 1½ tbsp red wine vinegar 2 tbsp red wine
Method:
In a small saucepan or frying pan, melt the butter and add the onions and garlic. Gently cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden. Add the sugar, vinegar and wine. Cook for another 10-15 minutes, until the mixture is sticky and coloured. Keep warm until needed.
