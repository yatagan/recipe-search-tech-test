Pineapple upside down cake
Introduction:
Tangy pineapple, moist sponge and a brown sugar topping. This cake works best with a very ripe pineapple. It's is good for teatime and dessert – especially popular at children's parties. Serve warm from the oven with a dollop of crème fraîche. 
Ingredients:
75g unsalted butter 200g light brown sugar ½ fresh pineapple, peeled, cored, sliced & cut in semi-circular shapes 275g self-raising flour pinch salt ¼ tsp nutmeg, grated, or ground cinnamon 185g unsalted butter, softened 250g caster or granulated sugar 2 eggs, beaten 1 tsp vanilla extract 125ml milk
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. In a saucepan, melt 75g butter. Add the brown sugar and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, then pour into 23-24 cm solid based cake tin. Arrange the pineapple slices in a layer over the butter mixture. Mix the flour with the salt and nutmeg or cinnamon. In a large bowl beat the 185g butter and sugar until light, pale and fluffy. In a small bowl, mix the beaten egg with the vanilla extract and milk. Gradually add the egg mixture to the creamed butter and sugar, stirring, then gently fold in the flour mixture. Pour on top of the pineapple, spreading it evenly. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until just firm to the touch. Test by inserting a skewer into the cake, if it comes out clean, it is cooked.
