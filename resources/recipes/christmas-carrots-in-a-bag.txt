Christmas carrots in a bag
Introduction:
A theatrical technique that seals in the flavour and lets the veg cook in its own moisture. You’ll need baking parchment and a stapler.
Ingredients:
8 good-sized carrots, peeled & chopped into 1cm diagonal chunks 1 cinnamon stick 1 star anise 3 whole cloves 1 bay leaf a little oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. To make the bag, spread out a rectangle of baking parchment, about 60x30cm, with the longer side towards you. Fold it in half from left to right. Double-fold the top and bottom ends and staple the folds closed with two staples. Put the carrots in a bowl, season well with salt and pepper and mix with enough oil so that the seasoning sticks to them. Tip all the ingredients into the bag with a dash of water. Double-fold the open edge of the bag and staple in both corners and in the middle. Lay in a roasting tin and bake for about 30 minutes; the bag should puff up. Turn out into a bowl or open at the table like a big bag of crisps. Watch out for the staples!
