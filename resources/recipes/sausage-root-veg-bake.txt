Sausage and root veg bake
Introduction:
This is simple winter cooking at it's best. Just toss all the ingredients in one baking tray and leave them in the oven while you get on with other things. Eat with a good big dollop of your favourite mustard, or if you've got a bit more time, with rich onion gravy. A pile of braised cabbage or winter greens would go down well too. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 6 good quality sausages 500g squash or mixed root veg; include any or all from carrots, swede, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips & celeriac 4 large garlic cloves, left whole 8 sage leaves, roughly torn olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Add a little oil to a frying pan, about 1 tablespoon, and brown the sausages on all sides (about 4-5 minutes). Toss the roots, garlic and sage in roasting dish with just enough olive oil to coat, and season well. Roast in the oven for about 20 minutes. Add the sausages and cook for another 20 minutes, or until the sausages are cooked through and the veg tender.
