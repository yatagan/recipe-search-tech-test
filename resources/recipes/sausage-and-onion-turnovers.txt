Sausage and onion turnovers
Introduction:
Really these are glorified, giant sausage rolls and they’re just as moreish. As with so many sausage recipes you start by slitting the skins and squeezing out the meat.
Ingredients:
500g pork sausage meat 1 medium onion, finely chopped 10g English mustard 400g puff pastry 1 egg, beaten
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Break up the sausage meat and brown it in a pan. Remove and cook the onions until soft. Stir in the mustard and sausage meat and allow to cool. Roll out the pastry and cut into 4x15cm squares. Divide the meat/onion mix into 4, shape into sausages and place across the middle of each pastry square. Fold over the sides so they overlap on top. Turn upside down and bake for 25-30 minutes. Egg wash halfway through cooking.
