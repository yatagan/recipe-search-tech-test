Pasta with turnip, turnip greens and garlic crumbs
Introduction:
A delectable, cheap and filling winter pasta dish. If your turnips come with fresh green leaves, use them here. If not, try kale or chard instead. If you'd prefer this vegetarian, leave out the anchovies and substitute another hard cheese for Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
400g turnip greens, chard or kale, or a mix, tough stalks removed 2 tbsp olive oil 4 anchovy fillets (optional) 2 large turnips, peeled & cut into large matchsticks 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 400g pasta e.g. penne crumbs from 2 slices bread 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Pull the large stalks from the leaves and discard. Blanch leaves in salted boiling water until just al dente – still retaining a little ‘bite’. Rinse thoroughly under cold water to stop cooking and squeeze out, then chop finely. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan and stir in the anchovies until they disintegrate. Add the turnip and when it begins to brown add the garlic and the chilli. Fry for another minute then add the greens and continue cooking gently until the leaves are soft and quite dry, around 7-10 minutes. Season to taste. Cook the pasta according to packet instruction. Fry the crumbs in the olive oil until golden and crunchy. Drain the cooked pasta, add the turnip and greens and mix through. Serve with the crumbs and Parmesan scattered over.
