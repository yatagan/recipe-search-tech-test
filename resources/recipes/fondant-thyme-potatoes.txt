Fondant thyme potatoes
Introduction:
Tender and delicious, this is a classic alternative to roast or boiled potatoes. Crisp and golden on the outside, yielding inside and gently flavoured with aromatic thyme. You could use rosemary as well or instead or thyme. This is a side that goes particularly well with roast meat. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled – ideally use same-sized potatoes 100g butter 100ml chicken or vegetable stock – you may not need all of it 2 sprigs thyme salt & pepper
Method:
For small to medium potatoes, cut in half lengthways. For large potatoes, cut into 2cm thick slices. Either way, aim for pieces which are all the same size so they cook evenly. On a low heat, melt the butter in a large heavy frying or sauté pan and add the potatoes. Cook gently for 15 minutes or so, turning the potatoes frequently until they are golden brown on all sides. Add 70ml of the stock and the thyme and simmer for a further 10-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender – test by inserting a knife in one side. Only add the remaining 30ml of stock if the pan boils dry before the potatoes are cooked. Season and serve.
