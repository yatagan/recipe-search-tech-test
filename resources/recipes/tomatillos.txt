Tomatillos
Introduction:
Beloved and omnipresent in Mexican cuisine for their tangy, fresh sweetness, you may see these appearing in your box over the next few months. The perfect foil to the some nose-sweating chilli heat. Remove their paper-lantern husks before using. 
Ingredients:
tomatillos
Method:
Most commonly used in a salsa, chopped or blended with some coriander, green chilli, red onion, lime and salt. Slice raw and fold into your tortillas, burritos or tacos. Dice with some ripe avocado and jalapenos as an offbeat bruschetta topping. Will cook down and collapse rapidly while still retaining a sense of freshness. Add them to a fiery chicken, pork or fish stew for the last 30 minutes or so. Try roasting them whole in a hot oven for 15-20 with a little oil and salt until blistered and yielding. A South American permutation of this punchy pick me up. Blend 5 tomatillos with one mini cucumber, a small handful of coriander and ½ a green chilli. Pass through a fine sieve to remove any pips and chill well. Mix with a few shots of vodka, or more appropriately tequila, and tweak with lime juice and a scant pinch of salt. Don’t fancy a post drink drink? Add a celery stick, green pepper and a green apple to the initial blend, hold the booze and thin with a little water and season. Serve it in a bowl and call it a Mexican gazpacho, garnish with diced avocado.
