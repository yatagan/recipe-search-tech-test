Green bean, steak and walnut salad
Introduction:
A lovely salad of barely-cooked beans, slithers of steak, crunchy walnuts and pungent blue cheese. This recipe can work as a side or a main and takes less than 15 minutes to make. Dry roast the walnuts for a couple of minutes for an even tastier finish. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 steak (rump or sirloin would be good) 150g green beans, trimmed 25g walnuts, chopped zest & juice 1 lemon 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp fresh chopped herbs (tarragon or rosemary would be good) 1 tbsp blue cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Make the dressing by whisking together the lemon juice and zest, olive oil, herbs and cheese. In a large frying pan, heat a little frying oil and cook the steak to your liking (about 3-4 minutes for medium). Season well. Once cooled, cut into pieces. Cook the beans in boiling water for about 5 minutes until they are just tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain again. In a large bowl combine the beans, steak, walnuts and dressing.
