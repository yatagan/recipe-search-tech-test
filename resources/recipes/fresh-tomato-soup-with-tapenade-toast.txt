Fresh tomato soup with tapenade toast
Introduction:
A vegetarian, dairy-free summer soup thickened with a light cornflour. This is both light and comforting – a very good dish for unpredictable English summers. Salty black olive tapenade on toast balances out the sweetness of the slow-cooked tomatoes, turning this into a complete meal. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 2 tbsp tomato purée 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 480g tomatoes, roughly chopped 1 tsp caster sugar 2 tsp cornflour 1 bay leaf 600ml veg stock slices of ciabatta, griddled or toasted for the tapenade: 1 pack black kalamata olives, pitted 2 tbsp capers, soaked in a small bowl of water for 20 mins, then drained 2 anchovies 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped leaves from 3 thyme sprigs 1 tbsp parsley, chopped, plus more juice of ½ lemon, more to taste about 5 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the onion gently in oil in a large pan for 10 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and fry for 2 minutes. Add the tomato purée and vinegar. Stir for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and sugar. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Make the tapenade: it’s easiest to blitz the olives, capers, anchovies, garlic and thyme in a food processor, then add the parsley, lemon juice and just enough oil to make a rough paste. Season to taste (you’ll need little or no salt). Blend the soup in a processor until smooth. Strain through a sieve, then return to the pan. Mix the cornflour with 1 tablespoon of water to make a paste. Add to the soup, with the bay leaf and stock. Season, then simmer for 15 minutes. Check the seasoning. Spread a little tapenade onto toasted ciabatta, sprinkle over a little extra parsley, then serve with the soup.
