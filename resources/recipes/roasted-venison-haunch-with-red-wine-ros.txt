Roasted venison haunch with red wine and rosemary gravy
Introduction:
Enjoy this fabulous dark, lean meat with celeriac mash and braised red cabbage, or with potato mash laced with whole grain mustard and buttery Savoy cabbage. Put a pot of redcurrant jelly on the table too for good measure. This recipe will give you a medium-rare joint of meat – cook it for longer if you'd prefer it to be well done. 
Ingredients:
for the roast: 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 650g venison haunch 2 carrots, peeled & roughly chopped 1 onion, roughly chopped 2 sticks celery, roughly chopped for the gravy: 100ml red wine 2 tsp redcurrant jelly 2 sprigs rosemary 250ml beef stock ½ tsp arrowroot (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 8. For the roast heat the oil in an oven and flameproof roasting tin, shallow casserole dish or frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the haunch and brown it on all sides. Place the veg tightly around the meat and season with pepper. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 180°C/Gas 4 and roast for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, transfer the meat to a plate and cover it with foil. Make the gravy while the meat rests. Add the wine, redcurrant jelly and rosemary to the pan with the veg still in it. Heat over the hob and stir to release any caramelised bits of meat from the pan. Boil for 1-2 minutes, then add the stock. Turn down the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes to reduce the gravy slightly. If you prefer your gravy slightly thicker, whisk the arrowroot with 1-2 teaspoons of water to make a smooth paste and stir into the gravy. Strain the gravy, season to taste and serve with the roast venison.
