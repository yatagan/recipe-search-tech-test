Rosemary garlic butter
Introduction:
This infused butter is good as a topping for hot smoked fish, but will go with any grilled fish or meat (especially lamb), or can be eaten simply stirred through pasta. For a subtler effect, use two or three cloves of roasted or boiled garlic (simmer the peeled cloves for about 40 minutes until very soft). 
Ingredients:
100g softened butter 2 tsp rosemary, very finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt salt & pepper
Method:
Mix all the ingredients together, then shape into a log. Wrap in cling film or foil and chill until firm. Cut into slices to serve.
