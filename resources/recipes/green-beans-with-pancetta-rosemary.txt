Green beans with pancetta and rosemary
Introduction:
This is a quick, easy and flavour-packed side which goes well with lamb or pork chops, or with grilled fish fillets. The same combination of rosemary and pancetta works beautifully with broad beans. 
Ingredients:
250g green beans 1 tbsp olive oil 1 slice pancetta or smoked bacon, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped Â½ tsp dried chilli flakes 2 sprigs rosemary, finely chopped 3 tomatoes, chopped a dash of sherry vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Put a bowl of iced water to one side. Blanch the beans in boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and put straight in the cold water to keep their colour. Drain when cool. In a pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil, then add the pancetta and cook for a few minutes until crispy. Add the garlic, chilli, rosemary and beans. Cook for 3 minutes and season. Add the tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes, then add the vinegar. Season, drizzle with a little oil and serve.
