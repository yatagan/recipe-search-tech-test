Dandelion soup
Introduction:
Making a simple soup from salad leaf may seem a little odd but it is not uncommon. This is based on a watercress soup, we are just trading a peppery taste for a bitter one. Added towards the end of cooking it retains its colour and clean fresh taste. This soup can be eaten hot or chilled. If it is a little too bitter, more lemon juice, cream and more parmesan will help to even things out.
Ingredients:
4 spring onions, 2 shallots or 1 small leek 1 large potato or a handful of cooked rice 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 bay leaf 600ml chicken or veg stock 150g dandelion leaves small bunch of parsley, chopped 1 lemon crème fraîche/cream Parmesan, optional salt & pepper 4 spring onions, 2 shallots or 1 small leek 1 large potato or a handful of cooked rice 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 bay leaf 600ml chicken or veg stock 150g dandelion leaves small bunch of parsley, chopped 1 lemon crème fraîche/cream Parmesan, optional salt & pepper
Method:
Clean, trim and slice the onions. Fry them gently in a little oil and butter for 5 mins until softening but not coloured. Peel and finely dice the potato, then add it to the pan with the garlic and bay. Fry gently for another 2 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until the potato is soft. Add the dandelion leaves. Cook for a further 3 minutes before adding the parsley. Remove the bay and blend the soup into a green purée. Season with salt, pepper and a cautious squeeze of lemon juice. Finish with a blob of crème fraîche or a swirl of cream. A grating of parmesan would not be amiss.
