Hot or cold tomato, herb and garlic dressing
Introduction:
An almost instant, very fresh tomato, herb and garlic dressing. This is good served warm over boiled new potatoes, or left to cool and used as a dressing for salad leaves, with some torn mozzarella. 
Ingredients:
4 tomatoes 60ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed Â¼ tsp cayenne 1 tbsp fresh basil, chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Cut a small cross in the stem of each tomato. Put some boiling water in a heatproof bowl. Add the tomatoes and leave for 45 seconds-1 minute. Remove from the bowl with a slotted spoon. When cool enough to handle, peel the skins, they should come away very easily. Halve the tomatoes and remove the seeds and core. Cut the remaining flesh into small diced pieces. In a pan heat the olive oil on a low heat. Add the garlic and cayenne and stir for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes. Stir for another minute or two. Remove from the heat. Add the basil, parsley and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
