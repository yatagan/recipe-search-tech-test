Glazed turnips with parsley
Introduction:
This is a good way to celebrate tender, young turnips, bringing out their sweet, robust flavour. If you have a few, garnish with chopped spring onions as well as parsley, which sets off their sweetness nicely. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp butter 1 tbsp sugar 4 turnips 200ml stock splash of balsamic or good vinegar small handful parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter and sugar in a saucepan, where the turnips can fit as one layer. Roll the turnips in the syrup. Add the stock, cover and simmer for about 15 minutes. When the turnips are nearly tender, remove the lid, turn the heat up and shake the pan so that they start to get a golden brown coating as the liquid evaporates. Add more liquid if the turnips are not cooked at this stage. Add a splash of vinegar, chopped parsley and season to taste.
