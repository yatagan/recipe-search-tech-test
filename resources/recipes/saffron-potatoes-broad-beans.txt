Saffron potatoes with Greek broad beans
Introduction:
The vibrant colours and flavours of Greece lend themselves well to vegan food. Often they can be just side dishes, but adding a pulse or bean makes them a more rounded meal. Weâ€™re using saffron to flavour the potatoes: par-boil them, then leave them to sit in the warm saffron water to finish cooking and soak up the colour and taste. 
Ingredients:
500g new potatoes, scrubbed & chopped into wedges 1 good pinch of saffron 2 bay leaves 1 lemon 400g broad beans, podded 1 onion, peeled & finely sliced oil for frying 1 garlic clove, peeled & finely chopped small handful black olives, sliced 250g cherry tomatoes 1 large sprig of oregano, leaves chopped (or 1 tsp dried) 1 tin dark lentils, rinsed & drained olive oil small bunch parsley, chopped small bunch mint, shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Put a small saucepan of water on to boil. Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan with the saffron and bay. Season with salt. Peel 3 fat strips of lemon zest; add those. Cover with water, bring to a low boil and cook for 7 mins, then remove from the heat and leave aside to soak in the saffron water. Boil the broad beans for 3-4 mins, until just tender. Drain the beans and rinse under cold water to cool them. Remove the outer skins to reveal the bright green bean inside. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan. Gently fry the onion, stirring now and then, for 8 mins. Stir the garlic, olives, tomatoes and oregano. Turn up the heat and cook until the tomatoes start to soften and burst, 2-3 mins. Stir in the lentils, broad beans, 2 tbsp of olive oil and a ladle of saffron water from the potato pan. Heat through, while you drain the potatoes, reserving a little more of the saffron water. Into the lentils, stir half the parsley and mint. Add a splash more saffron water if needed to loosen the mix more. Season and add lemon juice to taste. Serve the potatoes with the lentils, sprinkled with remaining parsley and mint.
