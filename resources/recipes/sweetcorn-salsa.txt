Sweetcorn Salsa
Introduction:
Make this half an hour in advance to let the flavour develop. It's a recipe open to variation: try adding any of a squeeze of lime juice, crumbled feta, avocado, red pepper or minced jalapeno pepper. Serve as a salad, a side to grilled meat or fish, as a dip for tortilla crisps, or a filling for quesadillas. 
Ingredients:
3 sweetcorn cobs ½ red onion ½ tin cooked kidney beans 2 tomatoes, deseeded & finely diced ½ red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil ½ tbsp red wine vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Cut the kernels off the corn and spread them out on an oven tray. Dry-roast for 20 minutes, to give a slightly smoky taste. Toss with the remaining ingredients and season.
