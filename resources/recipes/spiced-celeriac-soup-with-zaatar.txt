Spiced celeriac soup with za'atar
Introduction:
Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend of sumac, sesame seeds and thyme and hyssop – a herb a bit like thyme and marjoram. Make extra if you like, because as well as adding a lovely rich note to this easy-to-make celeriac soup, you can keep it in a jar to sprinkle on hummus, fried eggs or roast meat. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. rapeseed 1 large onion, chopped 1 tsp cumin 1 tsp coriander ½ tsp paprika ½ large celeriac, peeled & diced, tossed in the juice of a lemon as you cut it up, to stop it discolouring juice of ½ lemon 1.2 litres veg stock for the za’atar: 2 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted 1 tbsp dried thyme 1 tbsp marjoram (or use 2 tbsp thyme) 1 tsp fine sea salt 1 tsp sumac (a ground citrus-tasting powder, widely available but leave out if you can’t find it)
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and fry very gently for 10 minutes without colouring, until soft and translucent. Add the cumin, coriander, paprika, celeriac and lemon juice. Stir for 1 minute. Add the stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the celeriac is tender, about 20-30 minutes. Make the za’atar: Crush half the toasted sesame seeds in a pestle and mortar. Stir in the rest of the seeds, thyme, marjoram, salt and sumac. Blend the soup until smooth. Reheat gently if needed and check the seasoning. Sprinkle over a little za’atar to serve.
