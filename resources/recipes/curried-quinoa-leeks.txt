Curried leeks with quinoa
Introduction:
Combining sweet leeks and sultanas with the kick and aroma of curry powder and ginger, this is a quick, nutritious and flavour-packed lunch or dinner. High in protein and fibre, quinoa is great for vegetarians and vegans as it contains all the essential amino acids. Serve with a crisp green salad for a nice textural contrast. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp coconut oil 2 large leeks, very thinly shredded, washed 200g quinoa, rinsed in a sieve 600ml veg or chicken stock 100g sultanas 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 50g fresh ginger, peeled & finely grated 2 tsp medium curry powder 50g flaked almonds, toasted in a dry frying pan until golden salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the coconut oil in a heavy-based pan. Add the leeks and cook for 10 minutes on a low heat, stirring now and then. If it starts to catch at any point, add a splash of water and turn the heat a little lower. Meanwhile, put the quinoa and stock in a medium pan. Heat until boiling, then bubble for 10 minutes. Keep and eye on it so it doesnâ€™t boil dry. Top up with a little water if needs be. Once cooked, remove from the heat, add the sultanas (they will plump up) cover and leave to steam. Add the garlic, ginger and curry powder to the leek. Stir for 2 minutes. Stir in the steamed quinoa, flaked almonds and season to taste.
