Jerusalem artichokes and black olive tapenade
Introduction:
This delicious, easy-to-make tapenade will keep in the fridge for a good few days. The tapenade can be served with anything from boiled potatoes and steamed broccoli to pork chops and white fish. You could also dot it over a roast veg and goat's cheese tart. 
Ingredients:
500g Jerusalem artichokes olive oil for the tapenade: 350g black olives 3 tbsp capers, rinsed & drained 6-8 anchovies 1 large garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp lemon juice 2 tsp Dijon mustard olive oil small handful fresh parsley, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Wash and halve the artichokes and toss with a little olive oil. Season and roast for about 30 minutes, until tender. For the tapenade, blend all the ingredients apart from the olive oil and parsley in a food processor. Gradually add enough olive oil until the mixture is a rough paste. Pour the artichokes onto a serving dish, drizzle with tapenade and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
