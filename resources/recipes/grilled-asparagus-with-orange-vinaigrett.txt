Grilled asparagus with orange vinaigrette
Introduction:
A simple, sweet and tender vegetarian asparagus recipe. This is very quick to get on the table and is an elegant start to any meal. Or try as a side with baked eggs, or with new potatoes and fish or chicken. 
Ingredients:
1 shallot, finely chopped 2 oranges 20 fat spears fresh asparagus 1½ tsp balsamic vinegar ½ tsp red wine vinegar olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Place chopped shallot into a small bowl and finely zest one of the oranges over the top. Cut away skin and pith from both oranges and cut into segments by cutting down between the membranes. Work over another bowl to catch the juices. Set segments aside. Add 2 tablespoons of the collected orange juice to the shallots and zest, plus a pinch of salt and the vinegars, and leave to macerate. Meanwhile, snap the tough ends off the asparagus. Bring a wide pan of salted water to a rolling boil and blanch for 1-2 minutes until half-cooked. Lift out onto a tea towel to dry, and while still warm rub over a little olive oil and salt. Heat a griddle pan until extremely hot. Lay on the asparagus and grill for a couple of minutes on each side until nicely charred and cooked through. Finish vinaigrette by whisking in olive to taste (about 5 tablespoons) and more salt and pepper as desired. Taste and check the balance of oil to vinegar. Serve the asparagus warm dressed with the orange segments and vinaigrette.
