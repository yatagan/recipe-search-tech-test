Salad ni√ßoise
Introduction:
The 'correct' ingredients for this salad are much debated, but we think that if you've got good ingredients, simplicity is bliss and authenticity can take second place. If you dislike tinned tuna (or anything else) just leave it out. This fabulous salad makes a complete and nutritious lunch or dinner on it's own. 
Ingredients:
2 eggs 1 lettuce 200g runner beans, freshly boiled 2 ripe tomatoes cut into wedges 1 x 200g can tuna in olive oil 2-4 potatoes, freshly boiled & halved 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp wine vinegar (optional) 16 small black olives 8 anchovy fillets, split lengthways
Method:
Boil eggs for 4 minutes and then run under cold water to stop the cooking. Peel and cut into quarters, the yolks should still be moist. Cover a platter with washed, dried salad leaves. Gently mix warm beans, tomato, drained tuna, potato and egg with olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and tumble onto salad leaves. Scatter olives and anchovies over and serve immediately.
