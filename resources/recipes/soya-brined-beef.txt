Soy-brined beef
Introduction:
The normal suspects for ‘English’ brine are salt (up to 10%), sugar (5%), peppercorns, juniper berries, thyme and bay leaves. This is a more Asian-inspired recipe. Simmer for 20 minutes and cool before immersing your joint. Eight hours should give the salt and meat proteins time to get it on. Remove, pat dry, leave for an hour and cook as normal. 
Ingredients:
1 roasting bag 500g beef roast 250ml soy sauce 150ml mirin, dry sherry or proper scrumpy cider 25g ginger root, sliced 2-3 star anise 1 garlic clove 1 red chilli (optional)
Method:
Put the beef joint in a plastic bag with the soy sauce. Squeeze air out of the bag, tie and place in a plastic container in the fridge overnight. Remove the beef and tip the soy sauce into a saucepan. Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 20 minutes. Cool for 30 minutes. Place the joint in the roasting bag, pour in the stock, squeeze out the air, seal and immerse in a large pan of water and simmer, very gently, for two hours. Cool for an hour. You can eat it now or drain and press while it is still warm. When cool, slice as thinly as possible. Serve with a crunchy vegetable salad, kimchi or Malaysian pickled vegetables/penang acar
