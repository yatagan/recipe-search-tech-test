Gooseberry sauce for oily fish or pork
Introduction:
Gooseberries should not just be kept for pudding: they're great enhancers of oily fish, like mackerel, and fatty meat, such as pork. If you are serving this with fish, you could let it down with a little fish stock for a lighter sauce. 
Ingredients:
400g gooseberries, topped & tailed 25g butter 1 tbsp caster sugar
Method:
Place all the ingredients in a pan and cook slowly until the skins of the gooseberries start to burst. You can serve them rustically like this, or sieve them if you prefer.
