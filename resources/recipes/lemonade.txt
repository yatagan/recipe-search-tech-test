Lemonade
Introduction:
As Andrew Carnegie said, 'when fate hands us a lemon, let's try to make lemonade'. Traditional homemade lemonade is a lovely addition to picnics and barbeques. These proportions should make it tart and not too sweet, but adjust the sugar level to your liking.
Ingredients:
4 lemons 75g sugar 1.2 litre boiling water
Method:
Finely grate the rind from the lemons and place it in a heatproof jug with the sugar. Pour over the water and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Squeeze the juice from the lemons and strain into the jug. Allow to cool then chill.
