Sprout top caldo verde
Introduction:
Vitamin-rich sprout tops combine with potato and chorizo in this hearty Portuguese-style winter soup. You can even poach an egg in it for the last 5 minutes of cooking for an extra treat. If you prefer a thicker soup, mash a little of the potato into the liquid at the end of cooking. The sprout tops can be replaced by cabbage, kale or spring greens. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 500g cooking chorizo 1kg potatoes, peeled & cut into small dice 2 garlic cloves , crushed 2 heads sprout tops, stalks removed, leaves shredded 1 litre chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onion slowly in olive oil for 5 minutes before adding the chorizo and potatoes. Cook slowly for 20 minutes, to release oil from the chorizo. Add the garlic and stir vigorously before adding the sprout tops and chicken stock. Leave to simmer for 15 minutes or until potatoes are cooked. Season and serve.
