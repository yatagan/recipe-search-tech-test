Roasted Bloody Mary tomatoes with pesto and penne
Introduction:
A tomato sauce needn’t always be a smooth, tamed and pan-cooked affair. Roasting will intensify the flavour and give you those tasty, burnt and blistered edges. A bit of ham-fisted mashing and voilà, a rustic Riverford repast. The snifter of vodka is optional but recommended.
Ingredients:
250g cherry tomatoes, halved 1 red onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves olive oil ¼ tsp red chilli flakes celery salt Worcestershire sauce 2 vodka shots, optional 200g spelt penne pasta 2 tbsp green pesto salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Put the tomatoes and onions in a snug fitting roasting tray. Lightly smash the garlic cloves and tuck them amongst the tomatoes. Season with plenty of olive oil, the chilli flakes a few pinches of celery salt, a shake of Worcestershire sauce and a grind of black pepper. Pour over the vodka and roast for 30 minutes, turn once midway through. Slip the garlic from their skins and roughly crush the tomatoes in the tray, or coarsely blend them. Cook the pasta according to packet instructions, drain and add the tomatoes and pesto to the pan, mix and serve, with a grating of Parmesan if desired.
