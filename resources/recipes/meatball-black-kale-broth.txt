Meatball and black kale broth
Introduction:
A warm and comforting meatball and kale soup. This is a good meal for a cold winter evening. You can use black or curly kale or cabbage in this recipe, or try winter greens. Add in a generous handful of cooked grain (such as pearl barley) or a tin of white beans for something a little heartier. Or eat just with crusty bread to soak up the last of the broth. 
Ingredients:
for the meatballs: 1 slice white bread, whizzed into large breadcrumbs 2 tbsp milk 250g minced meat (pork or lamb) 1 egg yolk small handful fresh parsley, chopped 2 tbsp Parmesan, finely grated oil for frying, e.g. sunflower for the broth: 2 onions, finely sliced 1 tsp sugar 1 litre chicken stock 300g kale or Savoy cabbage, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
For the meatballs: In a large bowl, soak the breadcrumbs in the milk. Add the rest of the meatball ingredients and mix together well. Season. Roll into walnut sized balls. In a large frying pan heat a little oil and fry the balls for a few minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. For the broth: In another pan, heat a little more oil, add the onions and sugar and cook slowly until they turn a caramel brown colour. Steam the kale for 3-4 minutes. Drain well. When the onions are browned, add the stock, kale and meatballs. Simmer until warmed through. Season. Add Parmesan cheese to serve.
