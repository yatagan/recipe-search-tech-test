Strawberry custard Eton mess
Introduction:
A scrumptious mélange of rich, silky custard, sweet strawberries and light-as-a-feather meringue and cream. If your strawberries aren't perfectly ripe, macerate them in a generous sprinkling of sugar and a little balsamic vinegar while the meringue is cooking. 
Ingredients:
for the custard: 3 egg yolks ½ tsp cornflour 2 tbsp caster sugar 200ml double cream 150ml milk seeds of ½ vanilla pod or ½ tsp vanilla essence for the meringue: 3 egg whites 175g caster sugar for the cream: 300ml double cream zest of 1 lemon 2 generous handfuls strawberries, hulled & cut in half
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. To make the custard, whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl with the cornflour and sugar. Bring the cream and milk just to simmering point in a pan with the vanilla, then whisk gradually into the egg mixture. Pour back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a very low heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Leave to cool. For the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean dry bowl until they form soft peaks. Whilst whisking add the sugar tablespoon by tablespoon, continuing until the mixture is stiff and glossy. Spoon dollops onto a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Bake until completely dry - about an hour. Turn the oven off and leave the meringues in until completely cool (you can do this overnight). For the cream, add the lemon zest to the cream. Whisk to soft peaks. Combine the meringue, cream and strawberries in any artfully messy way you like.
