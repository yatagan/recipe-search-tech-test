Stuffing bombs
Introduction:
Think of this as a cross between a scotch egg and arancini. If you're making stuffing anyway just make a little extra for these nibbles. I recommend making 2-3 times the amount you think you'll need; I've seen people push their loved ones aside to get to the last few.
Ingredients:
500g herby sausage-meat stuffing* 100g fresh mozzarella or other good melting cheese 1 cup flour 2 eggs, beaten 200g Panko breadcrumbs oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
To make each one, take about 40g of the stuffing and press it in to a disc in the palm of your hand, break off a baked-bean-sized piece of mozzarella and push it into the middle and form the edges round in your hand so you end up with a ball of stuffing with the cheese in the middle. Roll into an even ball and repeat until it is all used up. To breadcrumb the balls, lay out 3 shallow bowls, put the flour in the first, the eggs in the second and the breadcrumbs in the third. One at a time dredge the ball in the flour, shake off the excess, dip and roll it in the eggs and drop into the breadcrumbs rolling and pressing until totally coated. Set to one side. Heat enough oil in a deep pan to deep fry with, bring slowly up to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Deep-fry until golden brown and piping hot in the middle. Keep warm in an oven and serve on cocktail sticks.
