Fried new potatoes and tangy dressing
Introduction:
This quick recipe is a really luxurious way to enjoy waxy new potatoes – start with ones that are perky and fresh, with no give when you press their skin. It's tasty enough to stand as a vegetarian main course, or goes particularly well with fish. 
Ingredients:
750g new potatoes, boiled until just tender (about 8-10 mins if small) & drained oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 200g pitted green olives, drained & finely chopped 100g capers, drained & finely chopped handful flat leaf parsley, chopped handful basil leaves, torn zest of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the potatoes into ½ cm slices or dice roughly. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large heavy frying pan and add the potatoes. Fry on a medium heat until the edges are crisp, about 10 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking, combine the olives, capers, herbs, lemon zest and seasoning. Drain the cooked potatoes on absorbent paper and tip into a serving bowl. Toss through about half the olive-herb mix and scatter the rest on top before serving.
