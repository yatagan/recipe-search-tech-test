Mustard-crumbed steak
Introduction:
'Tender it might be, but an escalope is never going to have the same eating qualities as a thick piece of grilling steak, so there is still work to be done. As usual, the Italians have come up with the answer – ‘scaloppini’ or ‘escalope alla Milanese’. The basic technique is egging, crumbing, shallow frying and serving with a wedge of lemon, but using different flavourings in the egg and crumbs leaves plenty of room for creativity.' (Ben Watson)
Ingredients:
2 frying steak olive oil 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 200g fresh breadcrumbs 1 tbsp cornflour 1 large egg, seasoned & beaten ½ a lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ºC/Gas 4. 'Escalope' the steak by placing the slice between two layers of clingfilm and gently tapping with a heavy rolling pin or mallet. Start from one end and keep tapping until you have an even thickness of 3-4mm. To make the mustard crumb, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil with the mustard until it melts through and then stir in the fresh breadcrumbs until they are well coated in the oil and mustard mixture. Spread on a baking sheet and cook, stirring occasionally until they begin to brown. This will take only minutes, so watch them like a hawk! Next, dust both sides of the beef with cornflour, dip in the egg and then the breadcrumbs. Repeat the egg and crumbing stages, making as many breadcrumbs stick as possible. Heat some oil in a non-stick pan. When nearly smoking, fry the escalopes for about 90 seconds on one side, gently turn over and fry for another 60 seconds. Serve with the lemon, new potatoes, and if it’s the right time of year, some griddled British asparagus.
