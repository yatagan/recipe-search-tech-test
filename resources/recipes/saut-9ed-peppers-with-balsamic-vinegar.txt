Sautéed peppers with balsamic vinegar
Introduction:
This is a quick, robust vegetarian side. It could be eaten with more-or-less any fish or meat. It's potent sweetness also makes a nice component of a hearty main-meal salad – perhaps with fried halloumi and rocket. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 large red onion, sliced 1 red & 1 green pepper, deseeded & cut into 1cm wide strips 1 garlic clove, finely chopped ½ tsp ground coriander ½ tsp balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil over a moderate heat in a wide frying pan. Add the onion and fry over a gentle heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Raise the heat and add the peppers and sauté briskly until tender and patched with brown. Add the garlic and coriander and continue to fry for a further 2 minutes. Tip into a dish and season with balsamic vinegar and season.
