Roasted pumpkin salad
Introduction:
This dish has a Middle Eastern feel to it; a cuisine close to James's heart as he grew up in the UAE. Wootton White is an English Greek style sheep’s cheese and can be substituted with feta. 
Ingredients:
400g pumpkin, butternut or onion squash, cut into chunks 150g pumpkin seeds, toasted 1 tsp sesame seeds 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tbsp coriander seeds, toasted & roughly crushed ½ tsp cayenne seeds 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 red onion splash red wine vinegar 1 tbsp sumac pinch of sugar 150g bag salad leaves 150g Wootton white or feta handful of toasted pistachios 1 small pomegranate 60ml olive oil 250g leaves, washed
Method:
Heat your oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Toss the pumpkin with oil and salt and roast for about 30 mins. Whilst the pumpkin roasts make the dukka. In a pestle and mortar grind the pumpkin and sesame seeds until broken up then stir in the cumin, coriander, cayenne and smoked paprika. Set mixture aside. Next, make the sumac onions. Slice the red onion as thinly as possible; a mandolin is best for this. Mix with the red wine vinegar, sumac, sugar and a pinch of salt and set aside for at least 30 mins, stirring every so often. When the pumpkin is ready, toss with the dukka mix then cook for a further 5 mins. Remove and leave to cool. Toss the salad leaves with the onions and olive oil and arrange on plates with the pumpkin and dukka. Top with crumbled Wootton white, pomegranate seeds and pistachios.
