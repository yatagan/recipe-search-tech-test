Kohlrabi and peanut stir-fry
Introduction:
Mildly sweet kohlrabi is a worthwhile vegetable but it needs tender treatment - the Asian seasonings here give it a real boost, with the peanut butter accentuating its delicate nutty flavour. This is a great quick weeknight dinner. 
Ingredients:
250g egg noodles 2 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsp sunflower oil 1 large or 2 small carrots, peeled & cut into thin matchsticks 1 large kohlrabi, peeled & cut into thin matchsticks 2 garlic cloves, grated 3-4cm piece fresh ginger, grated 1 chilli, chopped 1 bunch spring onions, finely sliced 150g sugar snap peas or green beans 3 tbsp hoisin sauce 2 tbsp soy or tamari sauce 2 tbsp water 1 good tbsp crunchy peanut butter 3 tbsp peanuts, toasted & chopped squeeze of lime juice, to taste 1 bunch coriander, leaves chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the noodles according to the instructions on the packet, then drain and toss with the sesame oil to prevent them from sticking. Heat the sunflower (or other cooking oil) in a wok. Add the carrot, kohlrabi, garlic, ginger and chilli, if using, and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add the noodles with the spring onions and the sugarsnaps or beans and cook for a further 2 minutes. Stir in the hoisin, soy or tamari, peanut butter, chopped peanuts and water. Heat through. Serve with a little lime juice to taste, season lightly if needed and sprinkle with coriander.
