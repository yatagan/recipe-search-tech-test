Simple celery soup
Introduction:
An elegant, cheap and easy-to-make vegetarian soup. This is pretty adaptable: add a little crumbled blue cheese if you like, or top with some crispy fried bacon pieces. You could also add thyme leaves along with the celery and potato, or stir in some chopped fresh parsley or chervil just before you serve. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 1 tbsp oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion, finely diced 1 celery head, trimmed, sticks thinly sliced 2 medium potatoes, peeled & diced 150ml white wine 1 litre veg stock, plus a little more to thin the soup as needed 125ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the butter and oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion on a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring now and then, until soft and translucent. Add the celery and potato. Stir for 1 minute. Turn the heat up a little. Add the wine and cook on a low boil for 2 minutes. Add the stock and season. Bring up to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 12-15 minutes, until the celery and potato are tender. Blitz in a food processor or blender. Return to the pan, add the cream and gently reheat, adding more stock to thin the soup if needed. Check the seasoning before serving.
