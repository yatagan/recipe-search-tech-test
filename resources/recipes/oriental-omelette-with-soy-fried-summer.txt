Introduction:
This prawn and bacon omelette with a side of greens is the answer for a light lunch or last minute dinner. It's further improved by the addition of chopped asparagus or purple sprouting broccoli if you have some in your veg box.

Method:
Cook the greens: heat a little oil in a pan and add the garlic. Fry on a medium heat for a couple of minutes, then add the greens and fry for a few more minutes until just tender. Add a splash of soy sauce and sesame oil to taste. Keep warm while you make the omelette (or make at the same time). For the omelette: In a bowl, beat the eggs. Add the soy sauce and sherry. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Add the bacon and fry for a minute, then add the onion and ginger and fry for a couple more minutes. Add the prawns, then the egg mixture and gently swirl around the pan until the mixture starts to set. Fold over and cook for another minute.
