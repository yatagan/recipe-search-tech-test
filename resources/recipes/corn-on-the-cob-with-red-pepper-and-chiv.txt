Corn on the cob with red pepper and chive butter
Introduction:
Fresh chive, pepper and chilli infused butter is a lovely accompaniment to sweet barbecued corn. It also works with other veg, or simply spread on toast. 
Ingredients:
2 red peppers 125g softened butter 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 chilli, chopped 1 tsp sweet chilli sauce 1 tbsp chives, chopped 8 corn cobs salt & pepper
Method:
Roast the red peppers in a hot oven or under the grill until the skin is lightly blackened. Place the peppers in a bowl, cover with cling film and leave for 20 minutes to help loosen the skins. Peel, discarding the skin and seeds. Put the butter, peppers, garlic, chilli and chilli sauce in a food processor and process until well combined. Stir in the chopped chives and some salt and pepper. Boil or barbecue the corn cobs until tender, then smear the butter on them while still hot.
