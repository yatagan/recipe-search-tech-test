Chicken, baby spinach and new potatoes with mustard
Introduction:
The original recipe uses broad beans which also work really well, but here they have been swapped for some seasonal spinach. 
Ingredients:
2 chicken leg quarters 2 chicken breast quarters 3 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable 1 large onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 500ml dry cider 400ml chicken or veg stock 2 bay leaves 700g new potatoes 200g baby leaf spinach 2 tbsp coarse grain mustard 2 tbsp double cream or crème fraîche 1 handful fresh tarragon leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the chicken quarters into manageable pieces. With a bit of prodding it’s easy to find the joint and separate the leg into thigh and drumstick. Place the breast, bone down on a chopping board and using a heavy knife, cut through the fillet and bone into 3 equal sized pieces. Cut off the wing and separate into three, discarding the wing tip. Heat the oil in a large pan and brown the chicken pieces. Don’t overcrowd the pan; you might need to do it in batches. Remove to a plate. Add a little more oil to the pan and add the onion. Fry gently for 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the cider, bring to the boil and let it bubble away for a couple of minutes so everything gets acquainted. Return the leg and wing pieces to the pan. Heat the stock and add to the pan with the bay leaves. Season, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chicken breast pieces and simmer for another 15 minutes. Add the potatoes and cook for another 20 minutes. Add the baby spinach leaves, together with the mustard and cream, and cook for another 5 minutes. Add half the tarragon. Tarragon can be a bit overpowering so taste and make a spot decision about how much more to add. Check the seasoning and serve – it doesn’t need anything more than a green salad.
