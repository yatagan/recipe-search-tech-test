Harissa
Introduction:
Harissa is a spicy North African sauce that can be use in a variety of ways. Toss mixed veg in a couple of spoonfuls before roasting or use as a marinade for meat or fish. Try carrot soup with harissa, or harissa baked aubergine. It can be frozen in ice cube trays so you can defrost spoonful portions as needed. There's no hard and fast recipe so vary the amount of spices and lemon juice and add extra chillies if you like it hot. 
Ingredients:
3 red peppers 6 dried chillies, more if you like it hot ½ tsp each cumin, coriander & caraway seeds, toasted & ground ¼ tsp smoked paprika (optional) ½ tsp salt 1 tbsp lemon juice, more to taste 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1-2 garlic cloves (optional) about 5 tbsp olive oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Place the peppers on a baking tray and roast until the skins are blackened (about 30 minutes). Remove and leave until cool enough to handle, then peel off the skins (they should rub off; it can help to place the warm peppers in a plastic bag or to wrap them in clingfilm). Remove the seeds and any white membrane and discard, leaving the soft flesh. While the peppers are roasting, soak the dried chillies in hot water to soften for about 20-30 minutes. Drain, cut in half and remove the seeds. Place chillies in a food processor or blender, add some freshly ground black pepper along with the flesh from the peppers and the rest of the ingredients, except the olive oil. Blitz, gradually adding the oil and until you have a smooth and fairly thick sauce.
