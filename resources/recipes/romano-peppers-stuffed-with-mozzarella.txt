Romano peppers stuffed with mozzarella and pesto
Introduction:
A glorious combination: charred peppers take on a smoky sweetness with is set off here by piquant pesto and creamy mozzarella. This is excellent as either a starter or side. You can either use shop-bought pesto or have a go at making your own. 
Ingredients:
2 romano peppers 100g mozzarella, sliced 2 tbsp pesto verde olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Place the peppers under a hot grill for 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is blackened in places, but not all over. Remove from the grill and leave to cool. Make a slit in the cooled peppers from top to bottom, taking care not to slice through both sides. Open them out a little and, taking care not to tear the pepper, remove the seeds. Fill the peppers with the mozzarella and pesto. Season. Drizzle with olive oil. Roast in the oven until the mozzarella has melted.
