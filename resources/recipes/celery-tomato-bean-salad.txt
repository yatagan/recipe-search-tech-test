Celery, tomato and bean salad
Introduction:
This unusual vegetarian salad takes under half an hour to make. Served warm or cold, it's substantial enough to be a light meal in itself, and is a great way to elevate celery from its usual supporting role and put it centre stage. 
Ingredients:
40g butter 1 celery head, diagonally sliced into pieces ½ tbsp chopped rosemary 100ml dry white wine small pinch saffron strands 100ml veg stock 300g tomatoes, deseeded & chopped zest & juice of ½ lemon 1 can cannellini or haricot beans, rinsed & drained 50g black olives, pitted & chopped in half small handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, melt the butter and add the celery and rosemary. Cook for 10 minutes or so on a gentle heat, until the celery is soft. Add the wine, saffron and stock. Bring to the boil and cook for 8-10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by about half. Add the tomatoes, lemon and beans. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Season, add the olives and parsley to serve.
