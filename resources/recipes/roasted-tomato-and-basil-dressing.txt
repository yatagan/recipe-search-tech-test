Roasted tomato and basil dressing
Introduction:
Intense roasted tomatoes and fresh, pungent basil make a perfect pairing in this easy dressing. It's good with all beans – broan, French or green – or as an easy topping for pasta or grains with lots of grated Parmesan or Pecorino. 
Ingredients:
10 cherry tomatoes olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar handful fresh basil leaves (about 6 large) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven 180°C/Gas 4. Cut the tomatoes in half crossways and place on a non-stick baking tray. Drizzle over a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Season. Roast for about 45 minutes, until soft and caramelising. Shred the basil. Mash together with the tomatoes, adding olive oil until it is of drizzling consistency.
