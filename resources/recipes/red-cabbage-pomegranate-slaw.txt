Red cabbage, winter root and pomegranate slaw
Introduction:
This is just the thing to add crunch and colour to a winter meal. To get the seeds out of your pomegranate easily, cut it in half crossways and use a rolling pin to bash each pomegranate half over a bowl, squeezing it now and then so the seeds fall out. Pick out any odd bits of pith that fall in as they're slightly bitter. There's no need to be at all exact about what you include in this slaw – just go for a bit of whatever you get in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
juice of ½ a lemon 1½ tbsp pomegranate molasses (readily available in shops, or use a little honey) 1 heaped tsp Dijon mustard 4 tbsp good olive oil ¼ large red cabbage, tough core & thick ribs removed, leaves finely shredded ¼ large celeriac, or ½ a small one, peeled & cut into fine matchsticks 1 large carrot, peeled & cut into fine matchsticks 1 small or ½ a large red onion, very finely sliced 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped seeds from 1 pomegranate salt & pepper
Method:
Whisk the lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, mustard and olive oil together in a large bowl. Season. Add the cabbage, celeriac, carrot, onion, parsley and half the pomegranate seeds. Gently toss together. Taste and add more oil, lemon juice or seasoning to your preference. Sprinkle over the remaining pomegranate seeds to serve.
