Stir-fried Asian noodles with pak choi and chicken
Introduction:
This is an ideal worknight dinner â€“ ready in about 15 minutes. Have all the ingredients prepared before you heat the pan as they'll cook very quickly. You could use shredded spring greens instead of pak choi, or substitute the chicken for pork or beef. 
Ingredients:
200g noodles (dry weight) 2 tbsp vegetable oil for frying 5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 200g chicken breast, thinly sliced 4 spring onions, sliced (use green & white parts) 300g pak choi, stalk end finely sliced, leaves roughly sliced pinch dried chilli flakes (optional) few drops sesame oil 2-3 tsp soy sauce, or to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the noodles according to instructions but try to have them slightly al dente since you will be reheating them. Immediately after cooking, plunge noodles into cold water then drain. Heat vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok until very hot and add ginger and garlic. Stir once then add chicken strips and fry for 2-3 minutes until chicken is opaque. Add the spring onion, pak choi and chilli if using and cook, stirring until the stalks are just cooked but still crunchy. Add a little more oil if necessary then add the noodles to the chicken and vegetables and stir through to heat. Add salt and pepper, sprinkle with sesame oil and soy and stir through. Turn onto a plate and add more soy, chilli, sesame and seasoning if you like before serving.
