Sticky onion marmalade
Introduction:
This sticky onion marmalade adds a little extra tang to any cheese and biscuit occasion, or great to tie a ribbon around and present as a gift to friends or family. Makes about 2 jars. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1kg red or white onions, finely sliced 150g light brown sugar 150ml red wine vinegar 125ml port (or red wine) 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onions and cook very gently for 30 minutes, stirring now and then, until very soft and caramelising. Add a third of the sugar and cook for another 15 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer on your lowest heat until the liquid has reduced and the onions are dark and sticky. This will depend on your pan, approx. 30-45 mins. You should be able to run a wooden spoon through and leave the pan clean underneath. Pot while hot into warm sterilised jars and seal with vinegar-proof lids. Store in a cool dry place and use within 3 months. Keep in the fridge once opened and use within a couple of weeks.
