Wild garlic & ricotta fritters
Introduction:
Make the most of seasonal wild garlic with these quick and tasty fritters. Serve as a starter or a light meal, with a herby grain salad or simply dressed green leaves. They're good with a salsa, a drizzle of pesto or squeeze of lemon juice. 
Ingredients:
100g wild garlic, washed well 1 egg, beaten 125g ricotta cheese, crumbled 20g Parmesan cheese (or vegetarian alternative), grated 1 tbsp rice flour 1 lemon, zested 1 nutmeg, for grating Oil for frying Salt & pepper
Method:
Boil a kettle. Put the wild garlic in a heatproof bowl. Cover with boiled water. Leave for 1 min, then drain and cool in cold water. Drain, squeeze out excess water and chop the leaves. In a large bowl, mix the wild garlic, egg, ricotta, Parmesan, rice flour and lemon zest. Season and add a little grated nutmeg, approx. ¼ tsp, to taste. Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan, to a medium heat. Dollop 4 equal spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan, pressing them lightly down with the back of a spoon. Fry for approx. 2 mins each side, until golden. Take care as you turn them; they’re a little fragile but will firm up as they finish cooking. Drain on kitchen paper.
