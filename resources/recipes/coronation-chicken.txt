Coronation chicken
Introduction:
Both luxurious and thrifty, this retro Anglo-Indian chicken dish from the 1950's is well worth reviving for a summer buffet or picnic. It’s also a good way to breathe new life into leftovers from a roast, though they’ll be less tender and fragrant than poaching your chicken from scratch. 
Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts 1 cinnamon stick 5 black peppercorns pinch saffron 1 tsp salt 1 bay leaf 4cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 5 tbsp mango chutney 50g soft apricots, finely chopped 2 tbsp curry powder 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce 200ml mayonnaise 200ml Greek yoghurt 50g flaked almonds, toasted small bunch fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the chicken breasts in a large pan along with the cinnamon, peppercorns, saffron, salt, the bay leaf and half of the ginger and cover with cold water. Lid and bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat so only the occasional bubble rises to the surface. Cook gently for about 15 minutes, switch off the heat and allow to cool in the water. Once cooled a little, cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Put the mango chutney and apricots into a large bowl. Toast the curry powder in a dry frying pan until fragrant, then add the rest of the ginger and stir both into the bowl, followed by the Worcestershire sauce, then the mayonnaise and yoghurt. Season. Once the chicken is lukewarm, mix in to the dressing and refrigerate for a couple of hours before adding the coriander and topping with the almonds. Serve with green salad and basmati rice.
