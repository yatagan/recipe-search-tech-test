Lamb shoulder steaks with onion, mint and redcurrant gravy
Introduction:
Serve these succulent steaks with mashed potato and a pile of greens for dinner that's ready in less than half an hour. Lamb goes particularly well with robust greens like kale and cabbage. If you've got a little more time, cabbage with lentils, chilli and coriander makes a delicious side. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil for frying small knob of butter (about 20-30g) 200g onions, finely sliced 1 tbsp light brown sugar 1 tsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp redcurrant jelly 2 tbsp red wine 200ml stock 1 tsp mint sauce 2 lamb shoulder steaks salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil, and all the butter. Add the onions, sugar and balsamic vinegar and cook, stirring only occasionally, on the lowest possible heat for about 30 minutes, until the onions are soft and just starting to caramelise. Add the redcurrant jelly and red wine. Cook for another minute or two then add the stock. Season. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the mint sauce and stir to combine just before serving. To cook the lamb, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a frying pan. Add the lamb and brown it on both sides, then season. Reduce the heat and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until cooked through. Serve with the sauce poured over the lamb.
