Romanesco and almond gratin
Introduction:
An easy-to-make, oven-baked dish of romanesco mixed with mustard, Cheddar and milk and topped with crunchy flaked almonds. It makes a good, midweek vegetarian main eaten with rice or quinoa and sautéed cabbage or kale. Use 50g of rice flour if you want to make this gluten-free. 
Ingredients:
1 Romanesco, cut into even florets 50g butter 50g flour (or use another starchy gluten-free flour, e.g. potato) 500ml milk 100g Cheddar cheese, grated, plus a little extra for sprinkling 1 heaped tsp Dijon mustard 2 small handfuls flaked almonds salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 8. Steam or boil the Romanesco for 4 minutes. Drain and allow any excess moisture to evaporate off. Melt the butter in a pan. Add the flour and stir on a very low heat for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add 3-4 tablespoons of the milk and whisk to a thick, smooth paste. Gradually add the rest of the milk, whisking all the time, until the sauce is smooth. Return to the heat, add the cheese and gently heat for a few minutes, until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened. Stir in the mustard and season to taste. Put the Romanesco in a snug fitting baking dish. Pour over the sauce and sprinkle over a little extra cheese. Bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle over the almonds and bake for a further 10-15 minutes or so, until the almonds are golden.
