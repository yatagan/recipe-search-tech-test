Roast potatoes with rosemary
Introduction:
Roasted potatoes are a simple crowd-pleaser and go well with all types of roast meat. They don't need any attention once they're in the oven – just leave them cooking and get on with the rest of the meal. You could also try using sage or thyme in place of rosemary. 
Ingredients:
600g potatoes, peeled & halved or quartered oil fresh rosemary leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ºC/Gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 8-10 minutes. Heat a little oil in a baking tray. Add the potatoes. Scatter the rosemary over potatoes and bake for around 45 minutes, until crisp and golden.
