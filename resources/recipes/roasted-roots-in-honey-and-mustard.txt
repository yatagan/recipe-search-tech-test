Roasted roots in honey and mustard
Introduction:
This is one of our favourite ways with root veg: roasted to intensify their flavour, then accented with a glaze of honey and mustard. It's a magnificent side to a Sunday roast or eaten on its own with couscous. This works well with parsnips, carrots, swede, celeriac or beetroot, or a mixture. 
Ingredients:
1kg root veg, peeled & cut into chunks, lengths or wedges olive oil 3 tbsp honey 3 tbsp wholegrain mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Toss the veg in a roasting tray with just enough oil to coat. Season. Roast in the oven for 40 minutes, turning once or twice so they cook evenly. Mix the honey and mustard together in a bowl. Mix with the roasted veg. Return to the oven for about 10-15 minutes or so, depending on your oven, until the veg is tender.
