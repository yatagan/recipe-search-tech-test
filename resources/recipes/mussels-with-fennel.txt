Mussels with fennel
Introduction:
It's very easy to cook mussels at home – and they're cheap, plentiful, sustainable and good for you. Serve this with crusty bread to soak up the sweet, faintly aniseed sauce, and perhaps a green salad on the side. 
Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small fennel bulbs, finely diced 1 tbsp butter 1 onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, chopped 200ml dry white wine 50ml water 2kg mussels, cleaned 2 handfuls fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped fennel leaves, finely chopped, if available 3 tbsp créme fraîche 2 tbsp Pernod or Ricard (optional)
Method:
Sauté the fennel in the butter until starting to soften. Place onion, fennel, garlic, wine and water into a large pan (with a lid). Bring up to the boil, turn down and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Raise the heat again to boil and add mussels, put lid on pan and shake over the heat for a few minutes until all mussels have opened. Discard any unopened ones. Remove mussels and place in serving dish. Boil down remaining liquid fast for three minutes. Add créme fraiche and liqueur if using, stir through chopped parsley and fennel leaves, and pour over mussels.
