Dandelion and beetroot salad with sheep's cheese and hazelnuts
Introduction:
The earthy beetroot, sharp and salty cheese, and buttery hazelnuts are brought together by the robust bitter taste of the dandelion leaves. If you find them too bitter you can consider mixing them with a milder leaf. If you make it while the beets are still warm the leaves will wilt a little when mixed, this can serve to smooth their more acerbic edge. 
Ingredients:
8 beetroots, roasted or boiled 2 tbsp red wine vinegar 2 tsp Dijon mustard olive oil 60g hazelnuts, toasted & skinned 150g dandelion leaves 150g sharp, salty sheepâ€™s cheese salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the skin from the beetroots and cut them into stout wedges. Mix the vinegar and mustard together and add 5-6 tablespoons of oil, bit by bit until emulsified into a dressing. Season well with salt and pepper. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts. Toss the beetroots and dandelion leaves with the dressing. Crumble over the cheese and scatter over the nuts.
