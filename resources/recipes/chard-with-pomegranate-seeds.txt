Chard with pomegranate seeds
Introduction:
This quick and supremely healthy side complements any Indian or Middle Eastern dish, and also makes a good accompaniment to Christmas dinner. Toasted nuts (try pecans or walnuts) and a sprinkling of grated Parmesan make excellent further additions. 
Ingredients:
about 400g chard, cleaned & tough stalks discarded 1 pomegranate 1 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the chard stalks into 1cm pieces. In a large pan of boiling salted water, cook the sliced stalks for 2 minutes, then add the leaves. Continue cooking until the leaves are just tender, then quickly drain and rinse thoroughly under cold water. Squeeze out and chop the leaves. Prepare the pomegranate. Score through the skin without cutting into the flesh all the way round the middle of the pomegranate (this avoids cutting into the seeds). Prise the two halves of the fruit apart. Use a juicer or wooden spoon to squeeze the juice from one half of the pomegranate. Pull apart the skin of the other half to release the seeds, picking out the white membrane. When ready to serve, warm the oil in a pan and add the chard, with some salt and pepper. Stir until the chard is heated through and remove from heat. Pour over the pomegranate juice, stir again and turn onto a plate. Scatter over the pomegranate seeds and serve.
