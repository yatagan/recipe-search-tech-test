Kohlrabi and potato gratin with lemon thyme
Introduction:
Kohlrabi is really versatile: grate or slice it raw for salads, steam or boil and toss in butter and herbs or vinaigrette, stir-fry, or add to soups and stews. It pairs well with herbs and citrus flavours so adding lemon thyme really lifts this dish. Serve as a side, or with a green salad as a main course. 
Ingredients:
small knob of butter for greasing 200ml double cream 100ml milk 2 sprigs lemon thyme, leaves only 2 garlic cloves, crushed 500g potatoes, peeled & very finely sliced 1 large kohlrabi (about 450-500g), peeled & very finely sliced 3 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease a gratin or baking dish with a little butter. Put the cream, milk, lemon thyme and garlic in a pan and heat until steaming. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 minutes. Layer the potato and kohl rabi in the gratin dish, seasoning each layer. Pour over the infused cream. Cover with foil and bake for 1–1½ hours, until the veg is just tender (this will depend on how thinly you’ve sliced the veg). Remove the foil and scatter over the Parmesan. Bake until golden.
