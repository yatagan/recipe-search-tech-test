Rhubarb yoghurt ice
Introduction:
You could bling up this yogurt ice cream into a sundae, with strawberry sauce, chopped nuts and a dollop of our clotted cream. Yogurt ice cream can set firmer than ordinary ice cream, particularly if you use a low fat one. This mix is particularly good with some chopped stem ginger added. 
Ingredients:
250g rhubarb, cut into 4-5cm lengths 60g caster sugar 50ml water zest & juice of ½ an orange 2 tsp elderflower cordial 450g greek yogurt 2 tbsp crème fraîche or double cream
Method:
Put the rhubarb, sugar, water, orange zest and juice in a saucepan. Heat gently, until the rhubarb is very tender. Remove from the heat, stir in the cordial, then leave to cool. Purée in a food processor, until as smooth as possible. Stir in the yogurt and double cream or crème frache. Transfer to a wide plastic container and pop the lid on. Freeze for about 4 hours, whisking well every hour to break up the ice crystals (or blitz it in a food processor each time for speed and ease).
