Moroccan lamb soup
Introduction:
This is a version of harira - a traditional North African feast-day soup made with chickpeas, lentils, lamb and warm, fragrant spices such as cinnamon and coriander. If you don’t have the vegetables listed below, substitute whatever is available. Despite the longish ingredients list, this is a very easy soup to make. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, chopped 3 carrots, diced 3 celery stalks, diced 1 leek, diced 4 turnips, diced pinch saffron 250g shoulder of lamb, cut into 1cm dice 3 garlic cloves, crushed ½ tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp ground coriander 200g red lentils (&/or yellow split peas) 400g tin tomatoes 1 litre chicken stock 425g tin chickpeas, drained 1 tbsp fresh coriander or mint, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the butter and oil in a large pan, add the vegetables and saffron and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the diced lamb, garlic and spices and cook slowly for about 20 minutes, until the vegetables and meat are lightly browned. Add the lentils and/or split peas and cook for 5 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes and simmer for 15 minutes over a low heat. Pour in the chicken stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the lentils are soft and the meat is tender. Stir in the drained chickpeas and season well.
