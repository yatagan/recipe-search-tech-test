Minted braised Little Gems
Introduction:
Little Gem's a miniature, crisper and sweeter version of Cos. It retains a bit of crunch when braised, but gains a whole new nutty flavour. If you throw a handul of frozen peas or broad beans in at the last minute and eat this with rice, pearl barley or spelt, it becomes a delectable and healthy vegetarian dinner. It's is also good served with lamb. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp light brown sugar ½ tbsp white wine vinegar 2 Little Gem lettuce 2 sprigs of fresh mint, leaves shredded 50ml chicken or vegetable stock, or use white wine salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Put the sugar, vinegar and 1 tablespoon of water in a small pan. Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat. Remove and discard any damaged outer leaves from the lettuce. Place the lettuce in an ovenproof dish with the half the mint, stock and sugar/vinegar syrup and season well. Cover and cook in the oven for 20–25 minutes, until the lettuces are tender. Scatter over the remaining mint to serve.
