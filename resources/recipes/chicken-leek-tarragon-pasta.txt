Chicken, leek and tarragon pasta
Introduction:
The aniseed-vanilla flavour of tarragon is a classic companion to chicken, and makes for a delicious speedy pasta dish. Tarragon is one of the herbs that freezes well, so if you buy a bunch to use in this recipe, freeze any left over. When you use it from the freezer, crumble it straight into dishes without defrosting. You can use dried, although the flavour is much stronger, so be sparing. 
Ingredients:
200g pappardelle, fettucine or tagliatelle pasta (or use another of your choice) 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 250g leeks, about 1 large, washed, trimmed & finely sliced (use white & green parts) 2 skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips 50ml dry white wine 2 tbsp fresh tarragon leaves, roughly chopped 2 tbsp pasta cooking water 100g soft cream cheese (a low fat version is fine) salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan of salted boiling water, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Reserve some of the pasta cooking liquid once cooked and drained. While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan. Add the leeks and cook gently for a few minutes until softened. Transfer the leeks to a plate and keep to one side. Increase the heat and add another tablespoon oil to the same pan. Add the chicken and cook for a few minutes until browned and cooked through. Add the leeks back to the pan. Add the white wine and cook for a minute or so, then add the tarragon, pasta water and cream cheese. Season well. Stir to combine and let the cheese melt, then toss with the cooked pasta to serve.
