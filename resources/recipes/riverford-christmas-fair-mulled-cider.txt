Christmas fair mulled cider
Introduction:
This mulled cider was so popular at our London Christmas fair that we’ve had endless requests for the recipe. Any dry, scrumpy type cider will do for it. Add in a splosh of Calvados (apple brandy), sloe gin or rum for something a bit more potent. 
Ingredients:
5 litres cider about 200g dark muscovado sugar 100g cinnamon sticks 25g allspice powder a few whole cloves large pinch nutmeg large pinch ginger
Method:
Put all the ingredients in a large pan. Cover with a lid and infuse at 60°C for 30 minutes. Strain off the cinnamon sticks and cloves, then reheat to serve. For mulled apple juice, leave out most of the sugar and add a couple of sliced oranges and lemons.
