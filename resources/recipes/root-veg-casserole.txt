Root veg casserole
Introduction:
Root veg have a natural sweetness which often appeals to children, as in this simple, stovetop casserole. It's suitable for toddlers 1 year + but tasty enough for parents too! Play around with delicate spicing – a little ground cumin or coriander – if you're not feeding a picky eater. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 450g mixed root veg e.g. potatoes, carrots, swede, parsnips, celeriac, turnips, sweet potato, peeled & diced 1 veg stock cube, dissolved in 500ml boiling water 400g tin cooked haricot beans (or cannellini), rinsed well & drained 1 tbsp cornflour or potato flour (these are wheat-free flours) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a heavy based pan. Add the onion and fry very gently for 8-10 minutes, stirring constantly, to soften the onion well (keep the heat very low so the onion doesn’t catch and burn). Add the root veg and stir for a couple of minutes. Pour in the veg stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the veg is soft. Add the beans. Mix the flour with a tablespoon of water and add that too. Stir well to mix in. Season and simmer for another 5 minutes to warm the beans and thicken the sauce. If you like, lightly mash half the stew for a slightly different texture.
