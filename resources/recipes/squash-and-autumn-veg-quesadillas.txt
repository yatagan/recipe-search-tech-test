Squash and autumn veg quesadillas
Introduction:
A great, family-friendly Mexican dish in between a stuffed pancake and a toasted sandwich. This is a delicious, easy vegetarian meal that goes down well with nearly everyone. It can be adapted to whatever veg you have in your veg box. Add braised kale or spinach, and use whatever cheese you've got in the fridge. This goes especially well with sour cream and guacamole. 
Ingredients:
1 small to medium-sized butternut squash, peeled & diced 1 red pepper, diced 1 cob sweetcorn, kernels removed 1 red onion, finely diced ¼ tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground cumin ¼ tsp paprika 1-2 fresh chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 4 large flour tortillas a little oil for brushing 100g Cheddar, grated 100g Double Gloucester, grated large handful coriander leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190'C/Gas 5. Toss the squash, pepper, corn, onion, spices, chilli and olive oil in a large baking dish. Season. Roast in the oven for 30-35 minutes, until the squash is tender. Brush each tortilla on one side with a little oil. Put one of the tortillas in a large non-stick frying pan, oil side down. Sprinkle some cheese over one half of the tortilla, then the veg mixture, then a few coriander leaves. Fold the other half of the tortilla over to make a half circle, gently pressing down with your hands to flatten. Cook for a minute or two, until the tortilla is crisp and golden brown (keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn). Carefully turn over using a large fish slice and cook on the other side. Keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the others. Cut each one in half to serve.
