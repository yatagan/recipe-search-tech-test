Saffron roasted Romanesco
Introduction:
The floral, honeyed-aroma of saffron adds lovely, subtle flavour to this dish of roasted Romanesco tossed with toasted walnuts, plump, sultanas and sweet-sour macerated red onion. Eat as a side, or as a simple vegetarian main tossed in a bowl with quinoa (or any grain) and sprinkled with tangy feta or goat's cheese. 
Ingredients:
1 small or ½ large red onion, finely sliced 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tsp light brown or caster sugar good pinch saffron strands 1 Romanesco, cut into equal florets olive oil for drizzling 2 tbsp sultanas, soaked in water for 10 mins, then drained small handful toasted walnuts, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6 Put the red onion, vinegar and sugar in a small bowl and leave to macerate. Put the saffron in another small bowl and add 3 tablespoons of boiling water. Leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes. Toss the saffron and liquid with the Romanesco florets in a baking dish, drizzle over a little olive oil and season. Roast until just tender but still with some crunch, about 20 minutes, depending on your oven. Mix with the macerated onion, sultanas and walnuts.
