Parmesan-coated pork escalopes
Introduction:
A simple, elegant dinner dish of pork leg steaks beaten thin and coated in crisp golden breadcrumbs. Eat with a green salad or a side of asparagus or creamed spinach. Grilled or pan-fried, pork leg steaks can disappoint but cut them in half, cover with clingfilm, and beat them out with a rolling pin into a 3mm-thin escalope and they make an admirable substitute for veal in wiener schnitzel. They’re wonderful cold the next day. If you have any cheese and breadcrumbs leftover, freeze them for next time. 
Ingredients:
1 small cup fresh breadcrumbs 1 small cup Parmesan, grated mixture of olive oil and veg oil to fry 4 pork leg steaks, cut in half & gently beaten out with a rolling pin 2 eggs, beaten salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the breadcrumbs and Parmesan together and season (go easy on the salt). Pour the oil into a deep frying pan to a depth of 2cm (you don’t want the escalopes to sit too heavily on the base of the pan or the coating will catch and come off). Heat the oil to frying temperature (about 170°C). Dip the escalopes in the egg, then the Parmesan breadcrumbs and lower gently into the oil. Fry for a couple of minutes, then turn over and repeat. Shake off the excess oil and dry on kitchen towel. Serve with lemon wedges and plain basmati rice. Allow the oil to cool and pour through kitchen paper or a coffee filter. You can re-bottle and reuse it several times.
