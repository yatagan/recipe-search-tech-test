Venison Rogan Josh
Introduction:
A rich and aromatic recipe for slow-cooked venison, this is good served over rice and/or with naan bread to sop up the juices. If you can’t get hold of venison, it’s equally good made with diced lamb. If you like your rogan josh hot, add in a finely chopped chilli or half a teaspoon of chilli flakes and eat with a generous dollop of yoghurt on top to balance out the spice. 
Ingredients:
350/500g diced venison 4 tbsp plain yoghurt, plus extra to serve 1½ tsp ground cumin 1 large onion, chopped 4 tbsp olive oil 2cm fresh ginger, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed 2cm stick cinnamon 4 green cardamom pods 1 tsp turmeric 2 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp hot smoked paprika 1 tin chopped tomatoes
Method:
Put the meat in a bowl with the yogurt and ½ teaspoon of the cumin. In a heavy casserole, fry the onion, ginger, garlic, cinnamon and cardamom pods in the oil over a medium heat, until the onions are translucent. Add the ground spices (including rest of the cumin) and mix. Cook for about 4 minutes to allow the spices to infuse into the onions. Add the tomatoes and a little water if the mixture feels dry. Next add the meat, yogurt and cumin mix. Gently cook on the hob on a medium heat for 40 minutes. Make sure the mix doesn’t dry out by topping up with a little water as needed. Keep cooking, uncovered, to thicken the sauce – the lower the heat and longer the cooking time, the richer the sauce will become; overnight in a slow cooker is best.
