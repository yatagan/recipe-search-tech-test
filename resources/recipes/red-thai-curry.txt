Red Thai curry
Introduction:
This fragrant Thai chicken curry makes a delectable dinner. If you have more time, try making your own red Thai curry paste – Thai pastes abound, but there is nothing like making your own: you just can’t replicate the fresh, zesty fragrance of kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass when it’s been in a long life, pasteurised jar. Eat with boiled or steamed white rice, greens and a good handful of coriander if you have some around. 
Ingredients:
for the paste: 1 tsp each of coriander seeds, cumin seeds, white peppercorns & salt 3 garlic cloves, chopped 2 fresh lime leaves (or 4 freeze dried) 1 stick fresh lemongrass, finely chopped 4cm fresh ginger (or galangal), finely chopped 3 fresh red chillies, deseeded & chopped 1 tsp shrimp paste (or 2 of fish sauce) for the curry: 600g skinless chicken breast, cut into large dice 275ml coconut milk 275ml chicken stock lemongrass stick, finely sliced lengthways 2 lime leaves 2 tbsp fish sauce 2 tsp sugar (ideally palm sugar) 3 tbsp broken cashew nuts, toasted in a dry frying pan handful fresh coriander, chopped
Method:
First make the paste: Grind the spices and salt together in a mortar. Transfer to a food processor and add the rest of the ingredients, blend to a coarse paste. For the curry, mix the curry paste with the chicken. Next, warm the coconut milk, stock, lemongrass, lime leaves, fish sauce and sugar in a small saucepan. Set aside to infuse for 20 minutes. Brown the chicken in a deep frying pan for 5 minutes, sieve the liquid into the pan and simmer for 15 minutes. Serve garnished with the nuts and coriander.
