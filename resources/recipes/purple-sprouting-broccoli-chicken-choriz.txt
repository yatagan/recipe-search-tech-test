Purple sprouting broccoli, chicken and chorizo pasta
Introduction:
This pasta's good for turning leftover roast chicken into the next meal, and it's quick enough for a busy evening. It's best made with purple sprouting broccoli when in season, but good too with normal broccoli or any other greens such as spinach, chard or kale. Use wholewheat or spelt pasta if you like â€“ they stand up well to the full-flavoured and robust ingredients used here. 
Ingredients:
400g fusilli pasta 350-400g purple sprouting broccoli, cut into similar sized pieces 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 200g cooking chorizo sausages, sliced 300g cooked chicken pieces, or whatever you have leftover small handful fresh parsley, chopped, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions in a large pan of boiling water. 3-4 minutes before the pasta is ready, add the purple sprouting broccoli. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large pan and add the chorizo. Fry on a medium heat until the chorizo is cooked and has released its paprika-coloured juices (it may start to break up, this is normal). Drain the pasta and purple sprouting broccoli, reserving a little of the pasta water. Add them to the chorizo pan with the chicken and a tablespoon or two of the pasta cooking water. Gently heat through to warm the chicken. Add the chopped parsley, if using and season to taste before serving.
