Wild garlic croquettes
Introduction:
Pungent, crispy golden croquettes for garlic lovers. If you’re serving this to kids or are trying it for the first time, you could halve the amount of wild garlic - these are quite potent. Serve as a main with veg or salad, or as a side dish to roast chicken, pork or lamb. If you want to go looking for your own wild garlic in spring, damp, shady, wooded places are the best. 
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, peeled & diced 50g butter 100g wild garlic leaves, finely chopped 2 eggs splash of milk salt & pepper 100g dry breadcrumbs
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Cook the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain and leave in the colander to steam dry for 2 minutes. Put them back in the pan and add the butter. Mash until smooth and season. Stir in the wild garlic. Leave to cool fully, then transfer to the fridge and chill for 30 minutes. Divide the mixture evenly into 12 and form into sausage shapes. Beat the eggs and milk in a bowl. Put the breadcrumbs in another bowl. Dip each of the sausage shapes in the egg, then the breadcrumbs to coat. Place on a non-stick baking tray and bake for about 25 minutes, until golden.
