Grilled pepper salad
Introduction:
A colourful, vibrant and quick-to-make vegetarian side or salad. This is a good accompaniment to seafood, chicken or lamb. Roughly chopped black olives, or strips of sun-dried tomatoes make good replacements or additions to anchovies, as does a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. 
Ingredients:
2 peppers 1 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp parsley, chopped or basil, torn 4 anchovies, sliced lengthways salt & pepper
Method:
Quarter as many peppers, green, red and yellow, as you need and remove seeds. Preheat the grill or barbecue thoroughly. Grill the peppers skin side close to the heat until the skins are thoroughly blackened and blistered. Drop into a plastic bag. Knot the ends and leave until the peppers are cool enough to handle. Once skinned cut the peppers into strips and place in a dish with any juice they have given out. Drizzle over the olive oil, garlic, parsley or basil, and anchovies. Season, toss together and serve.
