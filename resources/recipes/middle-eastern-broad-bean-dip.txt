Middle Eastern broad bean dip
Introduction:
Eat as a dip with slices of pitta or salady bits, or use as a sandwich filler. A healthy green alternative to the usual chickpea hummus. This is a good way to use up older, larger beans, but make sure you double pod them before puréeing if they are big. 
Ingredients:
1kg fresh broad beans in their pods 2 garlic cloves, minced 2 tsp ground cumin 1 tbsp lemon juice 2-3 tbsp olive oil & more to finish handful fresh coriander, chopped pinch paprika or sumac toasted pitta bread, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Shell the beans and blanch for 2-3 minutes until tender. Run under cold water then pop the inner beans out of their grey skins by making a small tear and squeezing gently (this isn’t essential for small beans, but for larger beans it makes the dish a brighter green as well as improving the taste and texture). Place beans, garlic, cumin, lemon juice, olive oil and coriander in a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine, but keep the texture slightly chunky. You can use a potato masher if you prefer. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn out onto a serving plate, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with paprika or sumac. Serve with toasted pitta.
