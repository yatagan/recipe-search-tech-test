Sweet potato, feta and olive salad
Introduction:
If you want to make this hearty, colourful vegetarian salad in the winter or don't have any fresh herbs to hand, use a pinch of dried herbs, preferably one with oregano â€“ either herbes de Provence or mixed herbs. 
Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, (about 250-275g each), peeled & cut into 8 pieces lengthways 200g feta cheese 3 tbsp fresh basil, shredded 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped a few fresh oregano leaves, shredded, if you have them, or use a pinch of dried 12 pitted black olives, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling 100g salad leaves salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling salted water, cook the sweet potatoes for 5 minutes. Drain and leave to dry. While the potatoes are cooking, crumble the feta into a large bowl. Add the herbs, olives and a tablespoon of olive oil. Season with pepper and stir to combine. Heat a griddle (or cook on the BBQ). Toss the sweet potatoes in a bowl with a little olive oil to coat, then griddle or BBQ for about 15 minutes or so, turning every now and then, until the potatoes are cooked through. Place the salad leaves in a large serving bowl, add the potatoes and sprinkle over the feta mixture. Drizzle over a little olive oil to serve.
