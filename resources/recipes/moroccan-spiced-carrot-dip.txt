Moroccan spiced carrot dip
Introduction:
Roasting carrots intensifies and caramelises their taste, which works beautifully with this collection of sweet, sharp and spicy flavourings. Serve this dip as a starter with warm pittas, or as part of a colourful mezze spread with a beetroot dip and a red pepper and cherry tomato dip.
Ingredients:
400g carrots, peeled & thickly sliced 2 tbsp olive oil, & extra for drizzling 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp paprika 2-3cm piece fresh ginger, grated 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tsp clear honey juice of 1 lemon 1 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted in a dry pan until golden (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6 Toss the carrots with the olive oil in a baking dish. Roast for 30-40 minutes until tender. Remove from the oven and crush with a fork. Stir in the cumin, cinnamon, paprika, ginger, garlic, honey and lemon juice. Season to taste. Alternatively you can blitz the roasted carrots in a food processor with the rest of the ingredients. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the pine nuts if using, to serve.
