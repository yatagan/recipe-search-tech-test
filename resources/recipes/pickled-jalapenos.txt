Pickled Jalapeños
Introduction:
Pickled peppers, perfect for topping nachos, chillies and pizza. They are also great chopped through slaws and sauces for an added piquant punch. Make sure your jam jar and lid have been sterilised with plenty of boiling water before using.
Ingredients:
150g Jalapeño chillies, sliced 250ml cider vinegar 150ml water 1 tbsp fine sea salt 1 ½ tbsp light brown sugar 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 bay leaf
Method:
Place everything apart from the peppers in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes to completely dissolve the salt and sugar. Pack the sliced peppers into the jar as tightly as you can. Pour the hot liquid into the jar to fill. Make sure the peppers are completely covered. Screw on the lid and allow to cool before storing in the fridge. They are best left for 2 weeks before using, to allow the flavours to develop. After that, use within a couple of weeks.
