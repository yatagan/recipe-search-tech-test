Penang acar (Malaysian vegetable pickle)
Introduction:
Variations on this vegetable pickle can be found throughout Southeast Asia. It is good as an accompaniment to curry or cold meats – but would bring a nice texture and sharpness to all sorts of dishes. Makes about 1kg. This can be stored in a well-sealed jar in the fridge for several weeks. 
Ingredients:
100g plain, unroasted peanuts 6 almonds 3 small onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 5 tbsp sunflower oil 1½ tbsp ground turmeric 300ml white vinegar 3 tbsp light soft brown sugar ½ tsp sea salt 500g mixed vegetables – choose from: carrots, sliced cauliflower florets cabbage, sliced cucumber, sliced French beans, sliced green or red chillies, sliced
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Put the peanuts on a baking tray and roast for 10–15 minutes, until browned. Rub off the skins and pound the nuts lightly in a pestle and mortar, then set aside. In a food processor, grind together the almonds, onions and garlic. Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion, garlic and almond mixture and fry for 3 minutes, until lightly browned. Stir in the turmeric, followed by the vinegar, sugar and salt. Add the sliced vegetables and cook for 5 minutes. Finally add the peanuts. Leave to cool, then transfer to a sterilised Kilner jar or a jar with a screwtop lid. Keep for 2 weeks before using. Once opened, the pickle should keep for about 6 weeks in the fridge.
