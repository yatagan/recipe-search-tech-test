Fennel and carrot purée
Introduction:
This easy purée can be made either with boiled or roasted veg. Roasting gives more intensity and sweetness of flavour, while boiling is quicker and fresher. This vegetarian dish goes well with both meat and fish. It also makes very good baby food. 
Ingredients:
4-5 carrots, roughly chopped 2 fennel bulbs, fibrous outer layer & stems trimmed off, bulb finely sliced 40g butter 2 tbsp sunflower oil 3-4 tbsp crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Place the roughly chopped carrot and finely sliced fennel in a saucepan and cover with water. Salt lightly, bring to the boil and simmer until the vegetables are very tender. Drain, and place in a food processor or blender. Add the butter, oil and crème fraîche and purée until smooth. Return to the pan and add salt and pepper to taste. Reheat just before serving.
