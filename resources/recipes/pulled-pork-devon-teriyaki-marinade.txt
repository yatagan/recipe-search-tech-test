Pulled pork with Devon teriyaki marinade
Introduction:
In southern parts of the USA pulled pork has justifiably acquired iconic status. The American version is a bastardisation of the Italian Feast Day dish of porchetta – somehow it crossed the ocean and was much altered. This recipe is more like the American South version, though either kind of slowly roasted or barbequed shoulder (or even leg of pork) is a joy. Serve in rolls, perhaps with a green salad, coleslaw and beans. 
Ingredients:
100ml cider 100ml cider vinegar 100ml soy sauce 50ml apple concentrate 100g brown sugar 1 tbsp salt 1 tbsp fresh ginger, peeled & grated 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp mustard powder 1 pinch chilli 1.2kg pork collar joint
Method:
Combine all the ingredients and pour over the pork, cover and refrigerate. The longer you marinade the better, but overnight should be fine. The next day place the pork in a slow cooker (or a very low oven, at around 120ºC/Gas ¼) and cook for about 6 hours. For the best, slightly smoky flavour, barbeque at the same temperature. When it is ready, place the pork on a chopping board and pull it apart with two forks and pile up in a bowl. For the BBQ sauce, take a ladle of the marinade/cooking juices, add a pinch of smoked paprika and an equal amount of tomato ketchup. Serve warm in rolls alongside a green salad or coleslaw and beans.
