Poached chicken
Introduction:
'Sadly, in these days of fierce griddles and grills, poaching meat isn’t the height of fashion. Don’t bother cooking a conventionally farmed bird in liquid (it’s textureless and tasteless enough without diluting it further), but it works a treat with our free ranging organic fowl. The meat will stay moist and the resulting clear stock will be incomparably better than anything got from boiling up your roast chicken carcass.' (Ben Watson) 
Ingredients:
whole chicken selection of leeks, carrots, celery thyme few peppercorns
Method:
Put your chicken or half chicken in a large saucepan or casserole along with stock vegetables, spices and aromatics. Add enough water to cover, bring up to a simmer and skim the surface. The secret is then to never let the liquid boil – if you have a meat or jam thermometer, keep it at about 85ºC. The chicken will take about 1½ hours from the time it reaches simmering point, depending on the size of the bird.
