Slow-cooked duck with fennel, leeks and Savoy cabbage
Introduction:
This luxurious but inexpensive recipe calls for a bit of time in the oven, but it's very easy and the crisp, golden duck legs and tender veg make it entirely worth while. Serve for Sunday lunch with the juices poured over creamy mashed potato, or make some roast potatoes. 
Ingredients:
¼ Savoy cabbage, cut into wedges 1 leek, cut into 5cm lengths ½ bulb fennel, cut into wedges 100ml chicken stock 1 tbsp red wine 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tbsp redcurrant or cranberry jelly leaves from 1 sprig of rosemary 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 duck legs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 140˚C/Gas 1. Mix the veg together in a baking dish that fits them all in fairly snugly. In a small bowl, mix the stock, wine, vinegar, redcurrant or cranberry jelly, rosemary leaves and garlic. Pour over the veg. Place the duck legs, skin side up, on top of the veg. Season the skin well with salt and pepper. Bake slowly in the oven for about 2 ½ hours, until the duck is soft with a crispy skin.
