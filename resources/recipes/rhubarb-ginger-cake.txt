Rhubarb and ginger cake
Introduction:
This rhubarb cake is a teatime favourite that's good both warm and cold. As it has fresh rhubarb in it, it should be eaten within three days – not usually much of a challenge! 
Ingredients:
340g rhubarb 55g crystallised ginger 100g wholewheat flour 100g unbleached white flour ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp ground ginger 110g butter 110g muscovado sugar 60ml black treacle or molasses 2 tbsp milk 2 eggs
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Remove any remaining leaf on the rhubarb plus any brown areas around the 'hoof ' of the stem (although the white part is fine, and indeed relatively sweet). Rinse and dice into 1cm pieces. Chop the crystallised ginger up quite finely. Mix together the flour, bicarbonate of soda and ginger powder. Add the chopped rhubarb and ginger to this and stir. Melt the butter in a saucepan with the sugar and treacle (or molasses). Cool slightly. Blend the milk and eggs into the cooled mixture, which can then be incorporated into the flour etc. Mix well. Turn the mixture into a prepared loaf tin or flat cake tins (bear in mind a deeper cake will take longer to cook). Make the mixture in a loaf tin not more than about 5cm deep to ensure even cooking. Bake for 30-60 minutes.
