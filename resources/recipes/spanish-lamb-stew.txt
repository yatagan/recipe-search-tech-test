Spanish lamb stew
Introduction:
The list of ingredients is daunting, but the dish is simple and well worth the effort. Its warm, flavoursome meatiness is best complemented by plain rice or crusty bread. Or you could add large handful of pearl barley, increase the liquids and have an easy one-pot dinner. 
Ingredients:
500g diced lamb seasoned plain flour 75g chopped bacon olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 200g cooking chorizo, cut into 1.5cm chunks 100ml dry white wine 50ml red wine 100ml vegetable bouillon grated zest & juice amp; of 1/2 orange & 1/2 lemon ½ tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp ground allspice ¼ tsp ground cloves 1 small cabbage or spring greens or black kale, very finely shredded 50g pine kernels, lightly toasted 3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Toss the diced lamb in seasoned flour and fry in a sauté pan, together with the bacon, in a little olive oil until browned. Remove with a slotted spoon to a saucepan. Add a little more oil to the sauté pan and cook the garlic and chopped onion over a low heat until softened and translucent. Transfer this to the saucepan with the lamb and bacon and scatter the chorizo pieces in there too. Return the sauté pan to the heat, add the white and red wine, and the bouillon, and deglaze the pan by scraping the base with a wooden spatula so that all residual flavour from the lamb and onions is incorporated in the sauce - now pour into the saucepan. Bring the stew to the boil, then lower the heat so that it cooks at a bare simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally. Check seasoning and adjust if necessary. Now add the orange and lemon zest and juice together with the spices and cabbage and simmer for a further 20 minutes by which time the lamb will be tender. Finally, immediately before serving, fold in the toasted pine kernels and chopped parsley. Serve immediately in warmed bowls.
