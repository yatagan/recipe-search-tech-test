Spiced carrot and broccoli salad
Introduction:
This Indian-style vegan salad has a good contrast of tender steamed broccoli and crunchy raw carrot. It goes well for a light lunch or dinner with grilled halloumi (or paneer cheese if you can get it). Or eat it with tandoori chicken and rice. 
Ingredients:
300g broccoli, cut into small florets 4 carrots, peeled & very finely sliced lengthways into thin ribbons (use a veg peeler to do this) 2Â½ tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp mustard seeds 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground cumin juice of 1 lemon handful fresh coriander leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Steam the broccoli for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl and add the carrots. Heat the oil in a small pan. Add the mustard seeds, garam masala and cumin, and fry gently until the mustard seeds start to pop. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice and fresh coriander. Season to taste. Pour the dressing over the veg and serve while the broccoli is still warm, or cold.
