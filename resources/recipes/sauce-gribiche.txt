Sauce gribiche
Introduction:
This is traditionally served with boiled meats, but works well with roasts too. 
Ingredients:
1 heaped tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 5 tbsp warm water 150-175ml sunflower oil 1 tbsp capers, chopped 1 tbsp gherkins, chopped 1 tbsp parsley, chopped 2 hardboiled eggs, chopped (optional)
Method:
Blend the mustard, vinegar, water and some salt and pepper and slowly add the oil, as if youâ€™re making mayonnaise. Tip into a bowl and stir in the rest of the ingredients. Allow to stand for an hour at room temperature before serving.
