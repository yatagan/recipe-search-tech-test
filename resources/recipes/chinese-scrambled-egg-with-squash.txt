Chinese scrambled egg with squash
Introduction:
This is a good, easy way of turning veg and a few eggs into a healthy last-minute dinner. You can get creative in adding different ingredients â€“ try a large quantity of chives and a few drops of soy sauce. Just make sure that you stir-fry the eggs very quickly, so that they don't dry out. To make this more hearty, eat it with some rice. 
Ingredients:
200g pumpkin or butternut squash 4 eggs 2 tbsp butter 1 garlic clove, chopped 1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped
Method:
Cut the rind and remove the seeds and fibres from the pumpkin or squash. You should end up with around 100g of flesh. Slice very thinly, then cut the slices into narrow batons, about 2.5-4cm long. Beat the eggs, adding salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a wok over a high heat until hazy. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry for a few seconds. Add the squash and stir-fry until lightly browned and tender. Pour in the beaten egg and quickly stir and scramble until beginning to set. Scoop into a dish and serve.
