Fried courgette and mint salad
Introduction:
This vegan salad works well as part of a mezze spread during the summer months when courgettes are plentiful. Flavours are much better if they're left to infuse for a couple of hours. Try serving with it with other Mediterranean style dishes such as bulgur and pine nut pilaf. 
Ingredients:
450g small courgettes 3 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled & sliced 1 Â½ tbsp red wine vinegar small bunch fresh mint leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Trim the ends off the courgettes and cut into 5cm lengths. If they are thin, cut pieces in half lengthwise. Fatter courgette pieces should be halved then quartered lengthwise. Arrange in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse and pat dry in kitchen roll. Fry briskly in the olive oil with the sliced garlic until browned and tender. As soon as the courgettes are cooked tip them into a shallow dish. Add the wine vinegar and mint, seasoning with salt and pepper, turn, then leave to marinate for several hours before serving.
