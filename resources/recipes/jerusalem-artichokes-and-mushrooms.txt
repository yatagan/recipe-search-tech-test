Jerusalem artichokes and mushrooms in a bag with goat's cheese
Introduction:
These earthy flavours work well together and look beautifully rustic when served in their parchment bags. As always with Jerusalem artichokes – and mushrooms – a drizzle of truffle oil would make a fabulous addition. 
Ingredients:
4 large Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed & cut into rounds 1cm thick juice of 1 lemon 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp thyme leaves 200g mushrooms, sliced 10g dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in 400ml boiling water for 30 mins 2 garlic cloves, chopped 75g goat’s cheese, crumbled 1 tbsp chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Mix the artichokes with half the lemon juice, a tablespoon of olive oil and the thyme leaves, season then set aside. Sauté the fresh mushrooms quickly in 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil until they are just tender. Season well and remove from the pan. Drain the porcini, reserving the soaking water. Chop roughly and cook in the remaining tablespoon of olive oil with the garlic for 2 minutes. Add the reserved soaking liquor and simmer until reduced and quite syrupy. Add the fresh mushrooms and the remaining lemon juice and season to taste. Spread out a large square of baking parchment. Tip the artichokes over one half of it, sprinkle the mushrooms on top and then fold over the parchment. Seal the 3 open sides by folding them over tightly, or simply use a stapler. Place the parcel on a baking tray and bake for about 45 minutes, until the artichokes are tender. Open the bag and sprinkle the contents with the crumbled goat’s cheese and the chives.
