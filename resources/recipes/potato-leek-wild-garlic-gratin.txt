Potato, leek and wild garlic gratin
Introduction:
This dish received an overwhelming response when we served it at the Field Kitchen in Devon. Pungent wild garlic sits beautifully amid cream and potatoes. It could either stand as a vegetarian main with some salad on the side (in which case you might want to substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese), or could be eaten with roast meat for a sumptuous dinner. 
Ingredients:
50g butter 300g leeks, trimmed & thinly sliced large handful wild garlic leaves 3 garlic cloves, crushed 100ml double cream 100ml milk 4-5 large potatoes, peeled & sliced 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Melt butter in a large pan - add leeks and cook gently until soft. Wash and roughly slice the wild garlic. Next, add garlic and wild garlic leaves and cook for 5 minutes. Season well. Add cream and milk and bring to the boil. Add 1 tablespoon Parmesan. Check seasoning. Mix in a bowl with potato slices. Arrange in a gratin or ovenproof dish. Cover with tin foil and bake for 1 hour until the potatoes are just cooked. Remove foil, sprinkle with the rest of the cheese - place back in the oven and cook until brown on top.
