Chicken pie
Introduction:
Traditionally, ham or bacon give a chicken pie a bit more depth although mushrooms can serve much the same purpose. The problem is that whereas with coq au vin you can add them right at the end, you can’t in a pie so they’ll end up overcooked. Leave them out and stick to bacon or ham. Leeks, the other traditional chicken pie vegetable, look, taste and feel much better. 
Ingredients:
150g diced cooked ham or streaky bacon 60g butter 3 leeks, roughly chopped 2 tbsp white flour 500ml chicken stock 200ml single cream 4 tbsp parsley, chopped 400g cooked chicken 1 egg 1 pack puff pastry salt & pepper
Method:
If you are using bacon rather than ham, fry the bacon in a third of the butter until the fat begins to run, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and add the rest of the butter. When melted, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until smooth and nutty. Add the chicken stock and cream, keep stirring and cook as with a white sauce. When it’s beginning to thicken add the parsley, leeks and bacon or ham. Check it’s not over salty, season accordingly and add the chicken. Preheat the oven to 180˚C/Gas Mark 4. Ladle the chicken and sauce into a large pie dish and allow to cool a little. Roll out the pastry to about 5-7 mm thick. Brush the rim of the pie dish with egg, then place the pastry on top, pressing down to seal. Make a hole in the top and brush with egg wash. Bake for about 30-40 minutes until the pastry is risen and golden, and allow to cool slightly before serving.
