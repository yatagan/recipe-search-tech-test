Chicken and cauliflower pilaf
Introduction:
This warmly spiced, fragrant chicken dish is quick enough for a weeknight dinner. Use cauliflower or romanesco – whichever is available. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large onion, sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped 4 chicken leg pieces ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground coriander 1 tsp chilli powder 2 tsp medium curry powder 200g basmati rice, rinsed & drained 500ml chicken stock 120g sultanas 1 small-medium cauliflower or Romanesco, cut into florets 2 tbsp fresh coriander or parsley, chopped 100g flaked almonds, toasted (or use cashews) plain yoghurt to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan (you need one with a lid, or use a baking tray as a lid instead) or large saucepan. Add the onion and fry on a gentle heat for about 8-10 minutes, until golden. Add the garlic and cook for a couple of minutes more. Turn up the heat, add the chicken and fry until golden on all sides. Add the spices and rice, and stir well to combine. Add the stock and sultanas and season. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring every so often. Add the cauliflower then simmer for another 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave to stand and steam for another 10 minutes, or until the rice is cooked. The liquid should have been absorbed into the rice or evaporated, but if you have a little left, place back on the heat for a couple of minutes. Stir in the fresh herbs and half the almonds. Check seasoning. Serve with a dollop of plain yoghurt, sprinkled with the rest of the almonds.
