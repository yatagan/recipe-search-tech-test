Taieddha
Introduction:
This Italian-style casserole requires a bit of preparation, but makes a wonderful summer weekend meal. Taieddha (or tiella) refers to the round, earthenware dish it's traditionally cooked in – though any ovenproof pot will work fine. This is best with waxy potatoes – floury ones will fall apart during baking. 
Ingredients:
2 medium onions 500g tomatoes, sliced 500g potatoes, peeled & sliced 350g courgettes, sliced 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 300g Arborio rice 3 tbsp olive oil 250ml water 500g mussels, washed & debearded salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. In an oven proof dish put alternating layers of the veg, and between each later sprinkle a little parsley, garlic and seasoning as you go. Cover with the rice. Pour in the oil and just enough salted water to cover the rice. Open the mussels by placing in a hot pan with about 1cm of water in it. Cover, shake pan for a few minutes. When mussels are just open, drain in a colander, reserving the cooking liquor. Strain the liquor and pour it over the rice. Bake covered in the oven for about 40 minutes or until the rice is tender, adding extra liquid if required. Take the mussels out of shells and put them in a half shell. Throw away any that have not opened. Place on top of rice and return to oven for 2 minutes. Serve.
