Pork chops with an apple and bourbon glaze
Introduction:
To give your pork a Southern theme, try griddling your chops with an apple and bourbon glaze. 
Ingredients:
100ml apple juice concentrate 50ml bourbon 1 tbsp dark brown sugar 1 tsp Dijon mustard 4 pork chops salt & pepper
Method:
In a small pan, bring everything apart from the pork to a simmer, stirring until everything is dissolved. Lay out the chops on a plate and season generously. Leave to marinade at room temperature for an hour. Heat your griddle pan and cook the chops for 2 minutes per side. Brush with the glaze and turn every minute or so until the chops are done.
