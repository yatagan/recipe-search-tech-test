Mushroom, potato and roasted pepper galette
Introduction:
A galette is a simple, free-form tart, less effort than a classic quiche. Crisp rounds of potato, smoky roast red peppers and meaty mushrooms make a lovely topping for these ones. Serve for lunch or dinner, either warm or at room temperature, with a big green salad.
Ingredients:
for the base: 7g dried instant active yeast or 15g fresh 1 tsp honey or caster sugar ½ tsp sea salt 200ml lukewarm water 3 tbsp milk 3 tbsp olive oil 320g plain flour, plus more to dust for the topping: 4 medium potatoes, sliced thinly 6 mushrooms 1 red pepper, roasted whole until the skin blackens, put in a plastic bag to cool, peeled, deseeded & sliced 2 tsp dried oregano or marjoram 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves 2-3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Put the yeast in a large bowl (crumble it if using fresh). Add the honey or sugar and salt. Pour over the water and leave in a warm place until it looks frothy, about 15-20 minutes. Add the milk and olive oil. Stir in the flour. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place for an hour or so. Preheat oven to 230°C/Gas 8. Dust two non-stick baking trays with a little flour. Knead the dough briefly on a well floured work surface – if it’s very sticky, add a little flour. Divide into two. Using your hands, or with a floured rolling pin, roll out each piece to a thin irregular round shape. Transfer to the trays. Lay the potato over the dough. Scatter over the mushrooms and peppers. Sprinkle with dried herbs, salt and pepper. Bake (one tray at a time if necessary) for 10 minutes. Remove, sprinkle over the fresh herbs and bake for another 3-5 minutes, depending on your oven. Serve slightly warm, or at room temperature, drizzled with a little more oil.
