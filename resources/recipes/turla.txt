Turla
Introduction:
Turla is a Middle Eastern bean stew with a creamy consistency, lots of colour and is a very healthy meal. This is a variation on the theme using broad beans where dried white beans would usually be used.
Ingredients:
1 head green celery, chopped large bunch fresh parsley, chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 25ml olive oil 300g potatoes, peeled & cubed 570ml vegetable stock 200g broad beans salt & pepper
Method:
Gently fry the celery, half the chopped parsley and the garlic in the oil. Add the potatoes and all the stock, bring to the boil and then simmer over a low flame. Cook and refresh the broad beans. Stir the stew occasionally, you may need to add a little water or stock during cooking. Turla is ready when the potatoes are just beginning to 'fall' i.e. they are starting to thicken the stew but are still whole. At this stage add the broad beans and the remainder of the parsley and plenty of black pepper. Serve with crusty wholemeal bread.
