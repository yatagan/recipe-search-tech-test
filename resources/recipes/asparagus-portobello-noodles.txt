Asparagus & Portobello noodles with spring onions & cashews
Introduction:
The cooking for this dish is done at such a pace that it is vital to have all your ingredients prepared and to hand before you start, preferably in the order they are to be used. If you try to prep anything while you cook, youâ€™ll inevitably overcook something. Keep the heat of the pan fierce. If you have one of those double-ring wok burners on your hob range then all the better. Watch out for spitting oil as you add the ingredients.
