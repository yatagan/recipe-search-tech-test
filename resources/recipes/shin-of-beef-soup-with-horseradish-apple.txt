Shin of beef soup with horseradish and apple sauce
Introduction:
This is simple, warming and delicious. Shin of beef has lots of connective tissue, but patient slow-cooking brings it to melt-in-the-mouth tenderness. An added bonus: it's one of the cheapest cuts of beef. Eat this slow-cooked stew with potato mash, or any other mashed root veg. The sauce is optional, but has a good kick that cuts through the richness of the stew. 
Ingredients:
2 Bramley apples, peeled & diced juice of ½ lemon 120-150g fresh horseradish, peeled & finely grated 250g beef shin, cut into rough 1cm dice 2 tbsp seasoned flour 1 tbsp vegetable oil 50g butter 2 onions, finely sliced 4 garlic cloves, crushed few sprigs thyme 1 tsp tomato purée 2 litres beef stock 250g cavalo nero or kale or spring greens or purple sprouting broccoli salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas 1. Make the sauce by gently stewing the apples to the point of collapse, then add the lemon juice and horseradish. Toss the beef in the flour and cook to a dark brown in the hot oil. Heat the butter in a saucepan and gently cook the onion, garlic and thyme for 7-10 minutes with a lid on until soft. Stir in the tomato purée and stock. Bring to a simmer, add the beef, season and cook gently for at least 3 hours in the oven until the beef is tender. Add the greens and simmer until tender. Stir in the apple and horseradish sauce. Re-season and serve.
