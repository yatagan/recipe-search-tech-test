Greek-style egg and lemon soup with spinach
Introduction:
This light, quick, fresh soup is based on a classic combination in Greek cooking: eggs, lemon and hot broth (Avgolemono). Use very good veg (or chicken) stock for the best flavour and eat it straightaway. For a more substantial non-vegetarian version add in shredded cooked chicken. 
Ingredients:
1.2 litre veg stock 100g orzo or other very small pasta shape 2 eggs juice of 1 lemon 1 tbsp cold water 150g spinach, washed, any tough larger stalks removed, roughly chopped handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large saucepan, heat the stock until boiling. Add the pasta and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl. Add the lemon juice and water. Remove the stock from the heat. Gradually add 2 ladles of stock to the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Place the pan back on a low heat, add the spinach and gradually add the egg mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly, for about 2-3 minutes, until the spinach has wilted and the soup has thickened slightly. Do not overheat or the egg will start to scramble. Add the parsley and check the seasoning just before serving.
