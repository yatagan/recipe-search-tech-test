Herby harissa
Introduction:
Turn this fiery, aromatic paste into a winning dinner by following our recipe for chicken with herby harissa and grubby rice. For a vegetarian side, mix a spoonful into a tray of roasted root veggies or braised greens. It also gives a satisfying kick stirred into soup, couscous or pasta sauce. Just be cautious how much you add to start with: a little goes a long way. 
Ingredients:
½ tsp each of cumin, caraway, coriander seeds 30g red chillies 300g Romano or red peppers, deseeded, roasted & peeled ½ dried mint 4 garlic cloves 1 heaped tsp (about 10g) salt 50ml olive oil 20ml white wine vinegar 1 tbsp each fresh mint & coriander leaf, chopped
Method:
Lightly toast and coarsely grind the spices and blend with the chillies, peppers and dried mint. Add the rest of the ingredients and pulse quickly to the right (slightly coarse) texture. I prefer it with visible pieces of greenery. Taste and adjust the spice and seasoning. Obviously you’ll be able to taste the 2% salt, but that doesn’t matter; You’re not going to be eating it straight. The combination of 2% salt and the oil and vinegar will help it keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge. On the other hand, if, like us, once bitten you become smitten you’ll need to make it in bulk.
