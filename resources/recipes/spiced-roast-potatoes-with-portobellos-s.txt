Spiced roast potatoes with Portobellos and soured cream
Introduction:
Well-spiced oven-roasted diced potatoes topped with mushrooms. This works as a vegetarian breakfast, lunch, brunch or dinner. Use a few closed cup mushrooms if you have those in your veg box instead of Portobellos. Add bacon, pancetta or chorizo if you're a meat-eater. Chopped spring onions make another good topping. 
Ingredients:
½ tsp whole coriander seeds ½ tsp whole cumin seeds 225g potatoes (about 2 medium to large), peeled & diced olive oil ½ tsp paprika 2 Portobello mushrooms squeeze lemon juice soured cream, to serve fresh parsley or coriander, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Crush the whole spices in a pestle and mortar, or use a bowl and rolling pin. In a pan of boiling salted water, parboil the potatoes for 5 minutes. Drain and return to the pan. Toss in just enough olive oil to coat, along with the freshly ground coriander, cumin seeds and paprika. Season. Transfer to a baking dish and roast in the oven for about 40 minutes, until golden. Keep warm in the oven. Meanwhile, brush the mushrooms with a little olive oil and grill until just tender. Season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Sprinkle with parsley or coriander if using and serve with the roast potatoes and a dollop of soured cream.
