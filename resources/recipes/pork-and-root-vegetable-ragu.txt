Pork and root vegetable ragu
Introduction:
This is a rich-tasting, easy to make sauce which goes a long way. It can be adapted to whatever root vegetables you have (except beetroot!). Pork works well, as does a mix of beef and pork mince, or substitute for lamb or turkey. Toss with pasta, use to layer a lasagne, or eat scooped over mashed potatoes. It freezes and reheats very well, so you could make more than one batch at a time. 
Ingredients:
olive oil 1 large onion, finely diced 1 celery stick, finely diced 400g pork mince 2 garlic cloves, peeled & finely chopped or crushed 1 good tbsp tomato purée 1 large sprig of rosemary, leaves very finely chopped 1 large glass (250ml) red wine 1 tin of chopped tomatoes chicken or veg stock (optional, or just use water) 300g mixed root veg (e.g. carrot, parsnip, swede, celeriac), chopped into 1-2cm dice salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan. Add the onion and celery. Fry on a low gently for 15 minutes, stirring now and then, until softened. If it looks like catching at any point, add a splash of water. Add the pork and stir-fry until it loses its bright pink colour. Add the garlic and tomato purée. Stir for 1 minute. Add the rosemary, wine, tinned tomatoes and root veg. Refill the tomato tin half full with water (or use a little veg or chicken stock if you have any) and add that too. Season and simmer very gently for approx 1 hour or so, until the veg is tender, giving the odd stir now and then. Keep an eye on the liquid level as it cooks, add a little more water or stock if needs be. Check the seasoning before serving.
