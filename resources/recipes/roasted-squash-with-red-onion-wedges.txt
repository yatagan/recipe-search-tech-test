Roasted squash and red onion wedges
Introduction:
Golden roasted wedges of squash and red onion with sage and garlic. This makes a lovely side, or turn it into a vegetarian main by serving with quinoa and a dressing of tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt and pepper. Garnish with chopped parsley or coriander, toasted pine nuts, and perhaps some salty goat's or sheep's cheese. 
Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small squash, cut into thick wedges with the skins left on 4 red onions, peeled & cut into wedges with the root intact a few garlic cloves, left whole a small handful sage leaves oil for roasting, e.g. vegetable salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Toss the squash, onions and garlic in a baking dish in just enough oil to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes. Toss in the sage (leaving small leaves whole and shredding larger ones) and turn the veg so they cook evenly. Roast for another 20-25 minutes until tender.
