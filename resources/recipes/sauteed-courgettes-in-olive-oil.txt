Saut√©ed courgettes in olive oil and garlic
Introduction:
Slow-cooked courgettes collapse into a chunky, caramel-tasting mass. Add a little cream for a pasta sauce; spread on bruschetta for a light lunch; whizz up into soup with a little stock or eat as a simple side. Parmesan, basil and parsley all make good toppings. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1-2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 3-4 courgettes, cut into 1-2cm slices on the diagonal few drops lemon juice (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Gently warm the olive oil in a heavy-based saucepan with a lid. Add the garlic and courgettes and cook, partially covered, over a low heat until the courgettes are soft and starting to caramelize. When courgettes are ready to serve add a squeeze of lemon juice if using, some salt and plenty of black pepper.
