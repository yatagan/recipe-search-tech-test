Eggs Florentine with roasted mushrooms
Introduction:
Roasted mushrooms add a touch more depth to the near perfect breakfast or brunch of poached eggs, spinach, hollandaise and muffins. Use organic eggs if you can to enjoy this combination at its best. 
Ingredients:
4 eggs 8 mushrooms (4 if big field ones) 2 tbsp olive oil 400g spinach leaves (preferably young/baby) 2 English muffins, split and toasted 3 organic egg yolks 2 tbsp water 1 tbsp lemon juice 150g lightly salted butter, cubed salt & pepper
Method:
To poach the eggs, fill a large non-stick frying pan with water, bring to boil and turn down to a low simmer. One at a time, break eggs into a teacup and slide into water. For a slightly runny yolk, simmer 2 minutes, turn off heat and let them stand for 10 minutes. Increase time for a well-done yolk. Remove eggs from pan with slotted spatula and dry on kitchen paper. Preheat grill. Brush mushrooms with olive oil. Place mushrooms grill side up on oven tray, season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Grill about 8 minutes until juicy. Place spinach in a large bowl and pour boiling water over. Stir until wilted, drain thoroughly, pressing through sieve or colander. Keep warm. Make hollandaise sauce just before serving. Put egg yolks, water and lemon juice in blender. Melt cubes of butter very gently. Take off heat as soon as melted. Start blender to whizz yolks and lemon juice together. Pour hot melted butter through blender lid in a thin steady stream to make a thick creamy texture. (Use quickly, but can be kept warm in a bowl set over simmering water). Split and toast muffins. Put on warm plate, top with roasted mushroom, a spoonful of spinach and a poached egg. Top with warm hollandaise and a good grind of pepper. Serve at once.
