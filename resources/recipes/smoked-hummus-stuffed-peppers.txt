Smoked hummus stuffed peppers
Introduction:
Our smoked hummus is made for Riverford by Natural Vitality, an award-winning small producer based just outside Bath. Mark, Ayleen and the rest of the team at Natural Vitality are obsessed with hummus: it’s the only thing they make. They make the hummus by hand in small batches and taste each batch to make sure it’s just right. This rich, creamy blend is made with oak-smoked chickpeas.
Ingredients:
2 red peppers Oil for roasting & frying 1 red onion, finely diced 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds 100g couscous Large pinch saffron 1 tbsp harissa Approx. 1 litre hot veg stock Olive oil 125g cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered 50g watercress 125g cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered 6 black olives, sliced 1 lemon 1 pot smoked hummus Small bunch parsley, leaves chopped Salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat your oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Halve the peppers, lengthways, through the stalk. Deseed them. Lay them cut-side up on a baking tray, drizzle with a little oil and season. Roast for 20 mins. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a medium saucepan. Gently fry the onion for 8 mins, stirring now and then. Add a splash of water if it looks like catching. In a dry frying pan, gently toast the pumpkin seeds for 3-4 mins, then transfer to a plate. Stir the couscous, saffron and harissa into the onion. Add a glug of olive oil and enough veg stock to just cover the couscous by 1cm. Stir, cover the pan with a lid or plate, and leave it to stand. Mix the watercress, cherry tomatoes and olives in a bowl. Remove the roasted peppers from the oven. Fluff the couscous up with a fork. Season and add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Spoon the couscous into the peppers, then top with dollops of hummus. Drizzle over a little olive oil and sprinkle with the pumpkin seeds and parsley. Toss the watercress salad in a little olive oil. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and season to taste. Serve the peppers with the salad.
