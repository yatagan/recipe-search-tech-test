Venison ragu
Introduction:
Serve with pappardelle pasta – ideally fresh homemade. It’s very easy and is worth trying. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil 1 medium onion, finely diced 1 medium carrot, finely diced 1 celery stick, finely diced 350g minced venison 1 tsp anchovy paste ½ tsp hot chilli flakes 1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, chopped 1 glass red wine 1 tin chopped tomatoes salt & pepper
Method:
In a heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil until smoking. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook until softened and light brown (12-15 minutes). Season the meat and add it to the pan. Stir it around quickly to get things started and add the anchovy paste, chili flakes, rosemary, red wine and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook for an hour keeping an eye on the liquid. If it gets too dry add a little water or stock.
