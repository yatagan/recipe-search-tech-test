Wet garlic rarebit
Introduction:
Rarebit is a real treat for lunch or dinner – this version is for garlic lovers. Serve with a big green salad for a quick lunch or dinner. We like using quite a dark beer for flavour, but go for your favourite, as you’ll be drinking the leftovers! The secret to success is to make sure the bread's a little dry so it keeps some crunch and the cheese stays on top. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 10cm piece wet garlic, finely shredded 1 tsp English mustard powder 50ml ale or stout splash Worcestershire sauce 200g Cheddar, grated 2 egg yolks 2-4 slices bread, depending on loaf size extra shredded raw garlic, optional
Method:
Melt the butter and fry the garlic for 2 minutes on a gentle heat. Whisk in the mustard powder and then the beer and Worcestershire sauce. Gently heat, adding the cheese and whisking together until smooth (don’t let it boil). Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Whisk in the eggs yolks. Heat a grill and toast the bread on one side. Turn and grill the other side, but don’t fully toast this side. Spoon the cheese mixture onto the toast. Grill until bubbling and golden. Serve with a little shredded raw garlic, if you like.
