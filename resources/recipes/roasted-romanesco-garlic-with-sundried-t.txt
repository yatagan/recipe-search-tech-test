Roasted romanesco and garlic with sun-dried tomatoes and olive crumbs
Introduction:
This piquant dish goes well with pork or fish, or make it into a main by tossing it with with pasta and a little extra olive oil. It stands up well to full-flavoured pasta – spelt penne or wholewheat fusilli. 
Ingredients:
1 head Romanesco, inner core removed, cut into florets 8 garlic cloves olive oil 100g coarse white breadcrumbs splash sherry or balsamic vinegar 16 olives, pitted & finely chopped 8 sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Place the florets in a baking dish with the garlic cloves and toss in about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and some salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for about 25 minutes, until the Romanesco has softened but still has some bite. Remove the garlic cloves and leave to cool slightly. Keep the Romanesco warm. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the garlic from the skins into a large frying pan. Squidge slightly with a wooden spoon. Add 4 tablespoons of olive oil, heat, then add the breadcrumbs. Continue to fry, tossing the crumbs from time to time, until they are turning golden. Add a splash of vinegar, the sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Cook for a couple of minutes more, then toss with the Romanesco.
