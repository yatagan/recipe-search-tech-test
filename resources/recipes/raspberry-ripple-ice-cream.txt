Raspberry ripple ice-cream
Introduction:
Rich, creamy custard ice cream rippled through with tangy raspberry: a summer classic. You don’t even need an ice-cream maker for this, but it does, of course, need a fair bit of freezing time. Eat on its own, with ice cream cones if you can find them, or with shortbread biscuits. 
Ingredients:
for the raspberry jam: 125g raspberries 60g jam sugar (this has added pectin to help the jam set) 2 tbsp water for the ice-cream: 4 large egg yolks 250ml whole milk 125g caster sugar 250ml double cream 200g sieved quick-cook raspberry jam
Method:
First make the jam: Put the raspberries in a small saucepan and mash lightly with a fork. Add the jam sugar and water and heat very gently so the sugar crystals dissolve slowly. Bring to a rapid boil and cook for 4-5 minutes to thicken. Remove from the heat, put into a sieve with a bowl underneath and push through with a wooden spoon to remove the pips and get as much jam as possible. Leave to cool. For the ice-cream: Whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together in a bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the milk just to the boil. Remove from the heat, leave for 1 minute then gradually whisk into the egg mixture. Return the mixture to the same pan and cook gently, stirring constantly, until it thickens to a pouring custard consistency. Transfer the mixture to a clean bowl. Leave until just cool then cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming. Chill in the fridge. Meanwhile, whip the cream to soft peaks. Add to the chilled custard and whisk together before transferring to a large plastic container. Cover and freeze for 2½-3 hours, until softly frozen. Remove from the freezer and whisk until slightly slushy. Return to the plastic container and swirl the jam through to make a ripple effect. Freeze again until firm.
