Slow-cooked lamb shoulder with root veg and homemade mint sauce
Introduction:
Thick slices of slow-cooked lamb with a rich gravy and roasted root veg tossed with toothsome pearl barley and parsley. This is a fabulous Sunday or Easter treat, especially if you make your own mint sauce – fresh is definitely more tasty than from a jar. 
Ingredients:
2 carrots, roughly chopped 1 onion, cut into wedges 2 bay leaves oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2.2kg lamb shoulder 1 garlic bulb rosemary sprigs 1kg mixed root veg, peeled & chopped into 2cm dice few thyme sprigs 800ml stock 250g pearl barley oil for roasting, e.g. olive large bunch fresh parsley, chopped for the mint sauce: 20g fresh mint leaves 2 tsp caster sugar 2 tbsp white wine vinegar good pinch fine sea salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 120˚C/Gas 1. Put the carrots, onion and bay leaves in a roasting tray that will fit the lamb fairly snugly. Heat a large frying pan with a bit of oil and brown the lamb on both sides. Remove it and lay on the veg in the tin. Cut small slits in the lamb and poke in some whole garlic cloves and rosemary. Season. Pour 100ml water into the bottom of the pan, cover tightly with foil and bake for 4 hours. Put the root veg in a roasting tin and toss in just enough oil to coat. After the lamb has been in the oven for 4 hours, put the veg in the oven and roast it for 2-2½ hours, until tender. Make mint sauce once the veg goes in. Mix all the ingredients with 3 tablespoons of boiling water in a small bowl. Cook the barley after the veg has been in for an hour. Put the stock and barley in a saucepan and simmer for 35-40 minutes, until tender but still with some bite. Drain and keep to one side until the veg is ready, then mix the root veg with the barley and parsley, seasoning well. Skim the fat off the lamb juices and use the leftover sauce for gravy.
