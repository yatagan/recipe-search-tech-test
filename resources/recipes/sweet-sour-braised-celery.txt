Sweet and sour braised celery
Introduction:
Braising celery makes it tender, mild and silky. This Jewish-Turkish dish (known as apio) gets its sweetness from honey and sourness from lemon juice. It's best at room temperature – eat as a salad, a side to fish or as tapas. 
Ingredients:
juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp olive oil 1-2 tbsp runny honey 100ml water 1 bunch celery, tough outer ribs peeled with a vegetable peeler, cut into 4cm pieces, tender inner leaves reserved handful flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Combine lemon juice, oil and honey with the water and ¼ teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil in a lidded pan large enough to take the celery and when honey has dissolved, add the celery. Cover and simmer gently until celery is tender and liquid has reduced to a syrupy glaze, about 35 minutes. If the pot loses liquid too fast before the celery has cooked, top up with a little more water. When celery is soft coarsely chop reserved celery leaves and sprinkle these over the celery along with the flat leaf parsley.
