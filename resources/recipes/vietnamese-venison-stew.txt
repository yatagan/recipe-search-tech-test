Vietnamese venison stew
Introduction:
Deeply fragrant with the sweet spice of ginger, star anise and cinnamon, this warming stew makes a lovely dinner on a cold evening with steamed rice to soak up the juices and braised greens on the side. It also works well with diced beef in place of venison. 
Ingredients:
450g diced venison 2 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 12 shallots, peeled 3cm fresh ginger, finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp Chinese five spice 1 cinnamon stick 3 star anise 2 stems lemongrass, bashed 1 tbsp fish sauce 2 tbsp dark soy sauce ¼ tsp unsmoked sweet paprika 2 tsp sugar 500ml strong beef stock 4 medium carrots, peeled & cut in 2cm slices 2 sweet potatoes, peeled & diced
Method:
Quickly brown the venison in the oil and set aside. Fry the onion and whole shallots until the onion begins to brown, then add the ginger, garlic, five spice, cinnamon, star anise and lemongrass and stir. Stir in the fish sauce, soy sauce, paprika, sugar, stock, carrots, sweet potato and venison. Cover and simmer very gently for 1½ hours, stirring occasionally, until everything is cooked. Discard the lemongrass, star anise and cinnamon and serve with rice and steamed greens. You’ll probably want some bread for mopping up the juices.
