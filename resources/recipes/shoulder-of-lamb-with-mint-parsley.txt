Shoulder of lamb with mint, parsley, garlic and harissa
Introduction:
You can expect to pay £40+ per kg for pine kernels so, in pesto, a good substitute would be sunflower seeds as they have a similar waxy texture. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped 50g pine kernels (or sunflower seeds) 4 generous tbsp parsley leaves, chopped 4 generous tbsp mint leaves, chopped 1kg boneless lamb shoulder ¼-½ tsp harissa paste (depending on strength)
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas Mark 3. Heat a pan with the olive oil and gently sauté the garlic for a few minutes. Add the pine kernels and cook until they begin to colour. Add the parsley, mint and harissa, and stir around until slightly wilted and the whole thing begins to come together. Remove the lamb joint from the netting, place on a board and unroll. Smear the stuffing mixture over the meat (inside boneless lamb shoulder and out), roll back up and stuff back into the netting. If this isn’t possible, use a bit of string. Wrap the whole thing up in tin foil and roast for 2 hours. If you like a caramelised crust, put all the stuffing inside (burnt mint leaves aren’t nice and blackened pine kernels are a terrible waste, so this will protect them), forget the tinfoil and roast at 170°C/Gas Mark 3½ for 90 minutes.
