Spiced potato wraps
Introduction:
Spicy sautéed potatoes wrapped in tortilla. This quick vegetarian dish can also be made with leftover boiled or baked potatoes, or with sweet potatoes. Add what you like to the basic components – mango chutney and thinly sliced raw red onion. Or try turning the yoghurt into a raita. 
Ingredients:
400g potatoes 3 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 tsp black mustard seeds 3 tsp cumin seeds 2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp turmeric zest & juice of ½ lemon handful fresh coriander or mint warmed flour tortillas, to serve plain yoghurt, to serve shredded lettuce, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and leave to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, peel and dice, or cut into chunks. Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the mustard and cumin seeds. Fry for a minute, then add the ground coriander and turmeric. Add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Fry for about 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice, zest and herbs. Check the seasoning. Fill warmed tortillas with some of the potato mixture, yoghurt and lettuce.
