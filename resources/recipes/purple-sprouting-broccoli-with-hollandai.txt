Purple sprouting broccoli with hollandaise sauce
Introduction:
This classic sauce goes well with our long-awaited homegrown purple sprouting broccoli. Try adding some fresh chopped herbs like tarragon or chives, or shredded wild garlic leaves. See our top tips for making hollandaise in our Purple sprouting broccoli with blood orange hollandaise recipe on the Riverford website. 
Ingredients:
2 egg yolks 450ml melted butter, ready in a jug 2 tbsp cold water lemon juice, to taste 350-400g purple sprouting broccoli salt & pepper
Method:
Put the egg yolks and water in a heatproof bowl that sits snugly over a pan of barely simmering water. Whisk until the volume has doubled and the mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and whisk for 20-30 seconds. Return to the heat and very gradually whisk in the melted butter, until the sauce has the consistency of double cream. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt to taste (if your sauce is looking a little thick as you whisk in the butter, adding a splash of the juice at an earlier stage can help). Leave the sauce in the bowl, over the pan holding the water, but taken off the heat, to keep it warm while you cook the purple sprouting broccoli. In a pan of boiling water, cook the purple sprouting broccoli for 3 minutes. Drain and season. Serve with a drizzle of hollandaise.
