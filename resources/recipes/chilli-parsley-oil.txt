Chilli and parsley oil
Introduction:
Drizzle this punchy dressing over simply cooked greens to pep them up. Stir through pasta with more fresh parsley for a quick weeknight dinner. Or eat with pan-fried scallops, squid, prawns, lamb chops or steak. This'll keep for a while â€“ but beware that as the chilli infuses the oil it will get spicier over time! 
Ingredients:
a small handful fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped 1 large garlic clove, crushed 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 100ml olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Mix everything together in a small bowl or shake in a jam jar. Season to taste. This keeps well.
