Ingen no goma-ae
Introduction:
For this you'll need a spice grinder or pestle and mortar â€“ grinding the toasted sesame seeds really releases their flavour. In Japan this quick and easy dish is a commonly served as a starter at room temperature, but it goes well with a vegetable stir-fry with noodles and tofu or chicken - or try it with fish. Instead of mirin or sherry, you could use a little sugar for sweetness. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp brown rice miso paste 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp mirin or dry sherry 300g green or French beans, topped & tailed
Method:
Put the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan. Heat gently, stirring now and then, until they turn a toasty brown colour (be careful not to burn them, they turn very quickly). Grind half the seeds in a pestle and mortar. Add the sugar, miso paste, soy, mirin or sherry, mix together so you have a thick dressing. Boil the beans in a pan of salted water (the salt helps keep the beans bright green) for 4-5 minutes, until tender but with a squeak when you bite into them. Toss the beans in the dressing and sprinkle over the rest of the seeds to serve.
