Slow cooked courgette pasta
Introduction:
Watch as the pan full of courgettes collapses into a thick and unctuous sauce. Very low and very slow is the key. Don’t be shy of having a play by adding some fresh herbs to the final mix or a pinch or 2 of dried chilli. 
Ingredients:
500g courgettes, very finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 200g pasta of your choosing lemon 1 tbsp crème fraiche Parmesan or Pecorino salt & pepper
Method:
Heap the courgette slices into a sauce pan with 2 tablespoons of olive. Add a pinch of salt and cook on a low heat for about 20 minutes, they should start to cook and reduce. Stir every so often and make sure they aren’t catching on the bottom of the pan. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another 15 minutes, adding a dash of water now and then if it starts to catch. Meanwhile cook your pasta. Season the courgettes with salt, pepper and a squeeze or 2 of lemon juice. Stir in the crème fraiche, some good olive oil and a dash of the pasta water to loosen. Mix with the drained pasta and top with a generous grating of cheese.
