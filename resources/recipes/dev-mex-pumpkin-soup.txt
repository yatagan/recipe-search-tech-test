Dev-mex pumpkin soup
Introduction:
We hold an annual Pumpkin Day at the farm, when we have up to 2,000 visitors. When we tried this Mexico-inspired pumpkin soup it flew out of the door. The ingredients list may look long but it's easy to make. Roasting the pumpkin gives a better result but is not absolutely necessary. 
Ingredients:
1 pumpkin or squash (about 1.5 kg), peeled, deseeded & cut into 2cm cubes 3 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, finely chopped ½ tsp smoked paprika 3 garlic cloves, crushed 2 red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 400g can chopped tomatoes 1 litre chicken or vegetable stock 425g can of red kidney beans, drained 2 cooked corn cobs 1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce juice of 1 lime 100g tortilla chips, crushed 75g Jarlsberg cheese, grated 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 1 ripe avocado, peeled, diced & tossed with the juice of 2 limes salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Place the pumpkin cubes on a roasting tray and toss them with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and some salt and pepper. Roast for 40 minutes, until slightly coloured. Meanwhile, heat the rest of the olive oil in a large pan, add the onions and cook for 20 minutes, until tender and slightly caramelised. Stir in the paprika, garlic and chillies and cook for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, simmer for 15 minutes or until reduced and thick, then stir in the roast pumpkin. Purée with a hand blender, slowly adding the stock until well combined. Bring to the boil and add the kidney beans and the kernels from the corn cobs. Season well, adding chilli sauce and lime juice to taste, and simmer for 10 minutes. Before serving add half of each of the remaining ingredients and fold them through the soup, then scatter the rest on top.
