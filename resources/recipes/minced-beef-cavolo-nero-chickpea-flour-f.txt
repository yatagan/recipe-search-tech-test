Minced beef, cavolo nero and chickpea flour fritters
Introduction:
This is a kind of glorified panelle (Sicilian chickpea chip) these can be served in a roll or, cut a bit smaller, as part of an antipasti with salsa, dips and Sicilian caponata.
Ingredients:
250g cavalo nero (or other kale) 1 onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 350g minced beef 1¾ mugs water 1 mug chickpea flour 75g Parmesan, grated
Method:
Finely dice the kale and blanch for 3 minutes in salted boiling water. Drain, cool and squeeze out excess water. Sauté the onion until soft. Add the garlic and minced beef and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Pour off any fat and tip the mixture onto some kitchen paper. Pat with more kitchen paper to dry. In a large saucepan, bring the water to the simmer and stir in the flour until fairly smooth. Add the kale, beef and onion mixture and cheese. Tip onto an oiled baking tray, cool and cut into squares. They will keep for several days in the fridge before frying, so you can fry them off as you need them. Fry in about 4cm of oil heated to 180°C/Gas 4 (watch them like a hawk) until golden and crispy. The quicker you eat them the better they will be, but they’re also good reheated for breakfast with an egg on top.
