Runner beans with roast tomato sauce
Introduction:
The tomatoes take some time to roast. If you're pressed for time you can fry them in the oil instead, but the taste won't be as intense. Eat with a heap of brown rice for a light dinner; with cooked meat or fish or a more substantial one; or cold as a snack. Try adding a bit of chilli to the tomatoes, and some fresh olive oil and chopped parsley at the end of cooking. 
Ingredients:
400-500g runner beans, in 1/2 inch lengths, steamed until tender 400-500g tomatoes, halved 1 tsp sugar 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 3 tbsp olive oil
Method:
Place tomatoes cut side up on non-stick baking parchment. Pour over some of the oil and salt and pepper. If the tomatoes are very bland add a teaspoon of sugar. Put them in a low oven (about 100°C or 120°C) for about 2-3 hours. Check from time to time - you're trying to concentrate the flavour - the tomatoes should shrink in size and maybe caramelise slightly. Remove from the oven and pull off the tomato skins. In a large frying pan, warm the garlic briefly in more oil until just soft. Add the tomato pulp and the beans and another tablespoon of fresh olive oil. Cook together for a few minutes. Check for seasoning and serve.
