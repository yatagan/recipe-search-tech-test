Spinach soup
Introduction:
The dark colour may be a little unappetising, but this has got the thumbs up in our canteen from packers, pickers and planters alike. Enjoy it as a light and nutrient rich lunch or dinner – you'll feel healthier after the first mouthful. 
Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped finely 2 tbsp oil 55g butter 30g flour 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock 680g spinach (chard would also work) ½ litre milk salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onions in the oil and butter over a low heat until translucent but not coloured. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes before slowly adding the stock while continuing to stir. Add the spinach, cover and bring to the boil and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Liquidise and return to the pan. Add the milk and seasoning to taste. Reheat and serve, perhaps with a swirl of cream and chopped parsley or chives.
