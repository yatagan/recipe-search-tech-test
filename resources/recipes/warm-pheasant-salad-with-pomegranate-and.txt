Warm pheasant salad with pomegranate and walnuts
Introduction:
This rich yet delicate dinner recipe presents pheasant at its very best – slowly cooked and set off by the sweetness and crunch of the pomegranate and walnuts. It goes well with creamy mash. 
Ingredients:
2 pheasants, legs & breasts removed veg stock 1 tbsp pumpkin oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp truffle oil 1 tsp soy sauce 100g mixed salad ½ pomegranate, seeds removed 2 tbsp walnuts, toasted salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and roast the pheasant carcasses for 30 minutes until browned. Put the pheasants in a pan with the veg stock and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1-1½ hours. Then strain the stock and reserve. Remove the skin from the pheasant legs and simmer in the pheasant stock for 1 hour until the leg meat falls off the bone. When cool enough, strip the leg meat from the legs and set to one side. Take half of the pheasant stock and reduce to about 200ml. Mix with the pumpkin oil, vinegar, truffle oil and soy sauce. Season well and add the leg meat to the pheasant dressing. Poach the skinless pheasant breasts in the remaining stock until slightly pink, about 10-15 minutes. Warm the leg meat in the dressing and toss with the salad. Arrange on a plate with the sliced poached breast and sprinkle with the pomegranate and walnuts. Drizzle over the remaining dressing.
