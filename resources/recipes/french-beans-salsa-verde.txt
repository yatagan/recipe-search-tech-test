French beans and salsa verde
Introduction:
This salsa verde recipe is just a guide: you can add basil, change the herb quantities, use lemon juice instead of vinegar â€“ just keep tasting to make sure you're going in the right direction. It's also delicious with fish and roast lamb. A food processor is a big help, but if you don't have one just chop the ingredients up by hand. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp capers soaked in water for 20 mins, then drained & squeezed dry 2 anchovy fillets small bunch flat leaf parsley 10 mint leaves 1 tsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp red wine vinegar olive oil 250g French beans, topped & tailed salt & pepper
Method:
Place the garlic, capers, anchovies, parsley and mint in a food processor and blend well (or chop finely by hand). Place the mixture in a bowl and add the mustard and vinegar. Drizzle enough olive oil to give it a thin coating consistency and season well. To cook the beans, place them in a pan of boiling water for about 5 minutes, until they are tender but with a bit of squeak. Serve tossed or drizzled with the salsa verde.
