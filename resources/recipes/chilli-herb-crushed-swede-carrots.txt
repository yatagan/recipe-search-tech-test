chilli and herb crushed swede and carrots
Introduction:
Check how hot your fresh chillies are by nibbling on the narrow end (the least hot part). Soak them in boiling water for 20-30 minutes to soften before using. If you're not a fan of chillies, this swede and carrot combination is great with just lots of freshly milled salt and pepper. 
Ingredients:
1kg mixture of swede & carrots, peeled & roughly chopped 50g butter 3 tbsp cream 1 fresh red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 tbsp fresh parsley or coriander, chopped grated zest of Â½ lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Steam or boil the swede and carrots until just tender. Drain and transfer to a large bowl, then add the butter and cream and lightly crush with a fork. Add the remaining ingredients and stir to combine.
