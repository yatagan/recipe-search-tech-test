Sweetcorn chowder with crab
Introduction:
This is a rich, flavourful chowder that's full of comfort but fresh enough for the summer. The delicate sweetness of crab and corn is a great pairing and you can use either fresh or tinned crab meat. If you are vegetarian leave out the crab – this is still packed full of interest. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. sunflower 1 onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tsp paprika 500g potatoes, peeled & cut into small dice 3 cobs sweetcorn, kernels removed 1 red pepper, finely diced 600ml veg stock 400ml milk 200g white crabmeat, picked over to remove any shell small handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chilli and paprika and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add the potatoes, sweetcorn, pepper and stock. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the potatoes and corn are tender. Purée half the soup in a blender. Return to the pan and add the milk and crab. Reheat gently, seasoning to taste and sprinkling with parsley to serve.
