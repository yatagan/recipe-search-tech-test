Sweet and crisp sugar snaps are best eaten raw, in stir-fries, or lightly steamed or boiled. Quick-boiled and buttery, this easy side goes very well with lamb, pork chops or salmon. 
Ingredients:
250g sugar snap peas 40g butter handful fresh mint leaves, finely chopped salt & pepper

Steam or briefly boil the peas until tender. Drain and put the butter in with the peas â€“ the heat of the peas should melt the butter. Add the mint, add salt and pepper to taste, mix well and serve.
