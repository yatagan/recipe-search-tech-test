Parsnip gnocchi with walnut dressing
Introduction:
Boiled then baked, these cloud-like gnocchi are far quicker and easier to cook than you might imagine, and make a delightful vegetarian main course. The secret for getting them super-light is to use as little flour as you need. Eat with a sharp walnut dressing – or just with butter, salt and pepper – and a crisp salad. 
Ingredients:
450g parsnips, peeled & diced 450g waxy potatoes, peeled & diced 250g plain flour (pasta flour if you can get it), & more if needed pinch nutmeg, grated 1 egg 100g walnuts, toasted & roughly chopped 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 4 tbsp olive oil 50g salad leaves or watercress a few shavings of Parmesan or Pecorino salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the parsnips and potatoes in salted water for 10-12 minutes, until just tender. Drain, mash well and leave to cool. Mix in a bowl with the flour and nutmeg. Season. Break the egg into the bowl. Bring together with your hands, kneading into a dough, adding a little more flour if needed. It should be light, pillowy and not too wet - don’t over-knead. Divide into 4. On a lightly floured work surface, roll and shape the pieces with the flat of your hands into sausage shapes 2cm in diameter. Cut into 2cm lengths. Roll into balls and press with the tines of a fork to make a traditional gnocchi pattern. Boil for 3-4 minutes in salted water, until they rise to the top. Drain. Place pattern-side up on a baking tray and grill until lightly browned. To make the dressing, gently warm the walnuts, vinegar, oil and leaves in a pan until the leaves are just wilted. Pour over the gnocchi and top with shavings of Parmesan
