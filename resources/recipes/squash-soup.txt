Squash soup
Introduction:
Squash soup is a trusty old favourite that is gorgeous as is, or can be dressed up with spices and garnishes. Try it with lots of black pepper or a pinch of chilli, or for a subtler flavour with cumin and coriander. Add a handful of cooked grain such as pearl barley, or a topping of crispy bacon, pumpkin seeds and a swirl of yoghurt. This makes a lovely warming and inexpensive lunch or dinner with a slice of crusty buttered toast. 
Ingredients:
1 squash, peeled & cut into chunks 1 onion, finely diced 1 litre vegetable stock dried chilli flakes, ground cumin & coriander (if desired) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190'C/Gas 5. Roast the squash for 25-30 minutes until tender. Fry an onion gently in oil for 10 minutes. Add spices if you like (dried chilli flakes, ground cumin and coriander). Blitz with the roasted squash in a blender with vegetable stock and seasoning.
