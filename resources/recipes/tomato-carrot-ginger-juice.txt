Tomato, carrot and ginger juice
Introduction:
Your use of citrus in this juice will depend on the sharpness of the tomatoes. The orange will add sweetness as well as tartness. This should yield about 3-400ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier, higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge. 
Ingredients:
1cm piece of ginger 1 celery stalk 3 carrots 3-4 tomatoes squeeze of lemon or orange, to taste
Method:
Put everything through the juicer apart from the citrus. Adjust with lemon or orange to your taste.
