Easy chocolate mousse
Introduction:
Making a rich, silky chocolate mousse is very simple – only make sure you do it a couple of hours, or a day, in advance so it has time to set. This dessert contains raw egg, so it is not suitable for everyone. 
Ingredients:
90g dark chocolate 1 tbsp of your favourite liqueur, brandy or rum (or water) 3 eggs, yolks & whites separated, at room temperature
Method:
Break the chocolate into small pieces. Put the chocolate and liqueur or water in a heatproof bowl, one that fits snugly over a pan of barely simmering water (don’t let the bowl touch the water). Melt the chocolate gently, then remove from the heat as soon as the last piece looks like it’s just melting. Leave it for a couple of minutes. Beat the egg yolks together, then stir into the chocolate. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Gently fold in about a quarter to a third of the egg whites until completely blended, then very gently and gradually fold in the rest, to keep the air bubbles. Make sure there are no white bits remaining and no chocolate streaks. Spoon carefully into a single bowl for sharing, or two ramekins. Leave to set in the fridge for at least 2 or 3 hours, or overnight.
