New potato and sausage salad
Introduction:
This comforting jumble of flavours makes a quick and easy midweek dinner. Eat with a buttery mound of cabbage, or stir through a handful of spinach at the last minute. It's good with a generous sprinkling of parsley if you have some to hand. 
Ingredients:
600g new potatoes, halved 1 tbsp olive or sunflower oil 6 sausages 2 onions, thickly sliced for the dressing: 3 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp white wine or cider vinegar 2 tsp wholegrain mustard 2 tsp honey salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water, cook the potatoes for about 12 minutes or until tender. Drain them and leave to one side. While the potatoes are boiling, heat the oil in a frying pan and add the sausages. Cook for 5 minutes or so. Add the onions and cook for another 10 minutes or until the sausages are cooked through. Remove from the pan and when cool enough, cut the sausages into chunks. For the dressing, whisk all the ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the potatoes, onions and sausages and toss with the dressing. Serve warm.
