Kale, cucumber, apple, celery & parsley juice
Introduction:
To extract as much juice as possible from leafy veg, roll them together tightly before putting them through the machine. Kale and parsley have distinct grassy and bitter notes, but they should be balanced out by the sweet apple and mild cucumber. A squeeze or two of lemon can combat anything that tastes too worthy. This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge. 
Ingredients:
100g kale 10g parsley 2 celery stalks 3 apples Â½ cucumber squeeze of lemon, to taste
Method:
Put everything through the juicer apart from the lemon. Adjust with lemon to your taste.
