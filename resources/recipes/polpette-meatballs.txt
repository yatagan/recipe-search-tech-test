Polpette meatballs
Introduction:
Wondering what to do with your mince? Think meatballs. Shape and size tend to be fairly constant but contents and seasonings are completely fluid; every country seems to have its own version, so pretty much anything goes. However, as with so many things, simple is often best and the fewer ingredients the better – it’s only a small mouthful so don’t complicate it. 
Ingredients:
350g beef mince & 150g pork mince or sausage meat (or 500g beef mince) 1 thick slice stale bread, crust removed, soaked in 75ml milk & gently squeezed to remove liquid 1 medium onion, finely chopped & gently sautéed for 5 mins 2 tbsp flat leaf parsley, chopped 2 tbsp Parmesan, coarsely grated pinch nutmeg, grated tomato sauce, homemade or otherwise salt & pepper
Method:
Mix all the ingredients together, working well with your hands. Form into about 30 small meatballs. Brown in olive oil, turn down the heat, wipe away any surplus fat and add your homemade tomato sauce. Simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes.
