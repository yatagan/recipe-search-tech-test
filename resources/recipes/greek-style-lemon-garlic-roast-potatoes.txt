Greek-style lemon and garlic roast potatoes
Introduction:
Very easy to make, these Greek-style roast potatoes are heavy on the olive oil but delicious. Good with roast or barbecued chicken, lamb or white fish. If you use small potatoes you needn't peel them, but it's best if you cut them in half to give a good surface for absorbing the garlicky, lemony flavours. 
Ingredients:
800-900g potatoes, cut into wedges (peeling optional) 200ml olive oil 70ml vegetable or chicken stock 3-4 garlic cloves, finely sliced juice of 2 lemons 2 tsp fresh oregano or rosemary leaves, or a combination, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220ËšC/Gas 7. Place potatoes in a gratin dish, shallow casserole, or deep roasting tray so that they form a single layer. Mix together remaining ingredients and pour over the potatoes. Bake for 25 minutes then turn potatoes and baste. Return to oven for another 30 minutes or until brown and sticky. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed and another squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
