Ingredients:
Squash
Method:
Mash: Peel and cut 1 squash into large cubes. Steam for 12-15 minutes, until tender. Mash with a potato masher or fork, adding a little butter or olive oil, grated nutmeg and seasoning. Serve with Cajun spiced chicken or pork, or with a roast. Pizza: Try using squash mash instead of tomato sauce spread over a pizza base; add wilted spinach or chard leaves, salami or Parma ham. Add some mozzarella pieces and grated Parmesan and bake in a hot oven until the base is cooked through and crispy. Roast: Either peel the squash and cut into dice, or cut into wedges with the skin on. Toss in a little oil to coat and season. Roast at 190Â°C/Gas 5 for 25-30 minutes, until tender. If the skin is thin you can eat the roasted skin too. Try adding some fresh herb sprigs (eg. thyme or rosemary) when roasting, or some spices (eg. cumin, fennel seeds, or a little grated nutmeg), or mix with other veg (eg. carrots, beetroot, peppers). Use in hearty salads or risottos.
