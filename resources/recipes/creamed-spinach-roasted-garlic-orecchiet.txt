Creamed spinach and roasted garlic orecchiette
Introduction:
You could use wet garlic when it’s in season. Instead of roasting it, finely shred about half to a third of a stick and cook with the spinach. Vegans could use egg-free pasta, oil for wilting the spinach, soy cream instead of double and leave out the cheese. 
Ingredients:
1 whole dried garlic bulb olive oil 250g orecchiette pasta (little ear shapes), or another pasta shape a small knob of butter 200g spinach leaves, roughly shredded 75ml white wine pinch ground nutmeg 100ml double cream 50g Parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), freshly grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Rub off the excess papery skin from garlic without separating the cloves. Slice the tips off, exposing the ends of the cloves. Place the garlic on a piece of foil, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fold the foil round to seal it. Put in a baking dish and bake until very soft, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven. Boil the pasta in salted water for 12 minutes until just tender. While the pasta is boiling, heat the butter in a large frying pan. Add the spinach and white wine (and wet garlic if you’re using it instead of roasted garlic). Heat gently for 3-4 minutes to wilt and let the wine evaporate. Add the nutmeg and cream, then squeeze in the pulp from about half the roasted garlic (use the rest to spread on toast or in other cooking). Increase the heat slightly and stir for 2-3 minutes to reduce. Stir in the Parmesan. Season to taste. Drain the pasta and stir into the sauce.
