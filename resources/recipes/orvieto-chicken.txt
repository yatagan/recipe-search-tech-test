Chicken & potatoes
Introduction:
This is usually served as a whole chicken with a potato stuffing, but is equally good, as pieces cooked over the potato. 
Ingredients:
1 large onion, sliced 70ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, chopped 600g potatoes, peeled & diced 1 large fennel bulb, diced 1 lemon, juiced 800g chicken legs 15 whole garlic cloves, skin on 200g pitted black olives leaves from large sprig rosemary
Method:
Sauté the onion in 20ml oil for 5 minutes, then add the 2 chopped garlic cloves, the potato and the fennel. Sauté for another 10 minutes and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the lemon juice. Next, preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Put the potato mixture into a shallow Pyrex dish, season the chicken pieces well, and place on top of the potatoes, skin side up. Strew the garlic cloves, olives and rosemary around the chicken and brush with the remaining olive oil. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Serve with a good salad.
