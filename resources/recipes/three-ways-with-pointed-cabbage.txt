How to cook pointed cabbage
Introduction:
The central stalk in each leaf should be good to eat if finely shredded but should be removed with a quick V shaped cut where it flares toward the bottom of the leaf. The best way to shred your cabbage is to take the trimmed leaves, stack 4 or 5 in a pile and roll them up like a cigar. Now cut into strips lengthways. You get a lot more cutting for your efforts
Ingredients:
Pointed cabbage
Method:
Comfort - Blanch in salted boiling water for 2 minutes and stir into buttery mashed potato to make some Irish colcannon, or add to cold mash and chopped leftovers, form into little patties and fry until golden brown for a take on bubble & squeak. Spiced - Try frying with chopped garlic, chilli and ginger and dressing with a shake of soy sauce. For something a little calmer take a knob of butter and a pinch of caraway and fry lightly. The cabbage shouldnâ€™t take more than a few minutes to soften Mix and wilt - Stir them into a whole host of dishes for a verdant finale. Think stews, risottos, soups, stir-fries, even trays of roasted veg for the last few minutes to wilt in the dropping heat.
