Leek and goat's cheese tart
Introduction:
With the sweetness of the leeks offset by the tangy cheese, this makes a delectable vegetarian main. It's good both warm and cold and will last well in the fridge for a couple of days. Eat alongside a crisp green salad with a sharp vinaigrette dressing - rocket leaves go particularly well. If you're not partial to goat's cheese, substitute feta. 
Ingredients:
for the shortcrust pastry: 175g plain flour 1 tsp caster sugar pinch salt 125g cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes about 3 tsp cold water for the topping: 6 leeks, washed & thinly sliced 50g butter leaves from 1 thyme sprig 50g goat's cheese salt & pepper
Method:
First make the pastry. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and process briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl and stir in enough water to make a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes Preheat an oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Make the topping while the pastry is chilling. Sauté the leeks in the butter with the thyme sprigs until soft and translucent. Roll out the pastry into a rough circle and cover with leeks. Roughly crumble some goat’s cheese over the top and bake for 15–20 minutes, until the cheese and pastry are lightly browned.
