Leeks cooked in wine with coriander seeds
Introduction:
A quick, elegant recipe for leeks poached in wine and olive oil. This dish makes a great side for anything fishy – from scallops to a fillet of salmon – and also for chicken. It can be eaten both warm and at room temperature. 
Ingredients:
6 leeks 150ml olive oil 50g coriander seeds 150ml white wine 150 ml water 3 bay leaves
Method:
Prepare the leeks and wash them well (cut off most of the green, the roots and slit them half way through), then cut each into 4 lengthways. Put the leeks in a large frying pan or oven dish with the rest of the ingredients. Bring to the boil and cook without a lid, stirring carefully until the leeks are cooked and the juice is reduced. Serve hot or cold.
