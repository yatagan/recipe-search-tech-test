Spiced lamb pittas with wild garlic, yoghurt and pickled cucumber
Introduction:
Wild garlic is a brief but abundant season. It carpets the woods surrounding the farm and on a warm spring day there is a palpable pungency in the air. It can be eaten raw, but a slight wilting in the pan mellows the taste.
Ingredients:
½ cucumber 2 tbsp cider vinegar 2 tsp brown sugar 300g minced lamb oil for frying & roasting e.g. sunflower or light olive lamb spice pot: ¼ tsp cinnamon ½ tsp oregano 1 tsp smoked paprika 1 tin chopped tomatoes 1 tbsp harissa 100g wild garlic 1 red onion, use ½ if large, all if small 15g mint 1 tsp poppy seeds pack pitta breads 2 dollops yoghurt salt & pepper
Method:
Wash the cucumber and cut it in half. Keep half for another day. Split the other lengthways and remove the soft seedy core with the tip of a teaspoon. Cut into thin slices. Mix the vinegar with the sugar and a generous pinch of salt. Mix until the sugar and salt dissolve. In a shallow tray or bowl mix the cucumber with the vinegar. Leave to marinate, turning occasionally. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the frying pan until nearly smoking hot. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and add it to the pan. Fry for 5 minutes until it is nicely coloured and browned. Add the spice pot to the lamb and fry for a further 2 minutes. Tip in the chopped tomatoes and harissa, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 20 minutes. Add a dash of water if it looks like it may dry out too much and start to catch and burn.
