Persian mushroom salad
Introduction:
These fragrant mushrooms go well on top of a pile of brown rice or spelt for a healthy weeknight dinner, perhaps with a few cooked leeks on the side. Or serve them as a starter with pittas to scoop them up. 
Ingredients:
1½ tbsp olive oil 1 small onion, finely diced, or 2 spring onions, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 200g mushrooms, sliced juice of ½ lemon 125ml plain yoghurt small bunch dill, leaves roughly chopped 3-4 mint leaves, finely shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion and fry gently until softened (about 10 minutes for a standard onion, 3-4 for spring onions). Add garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Toss in the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly; they should still have some bite to them. Transfer to a bowl, season well and add lemon juice to taste. Leave to cool. Just before serving, stir in the yoghurt and herbs.
