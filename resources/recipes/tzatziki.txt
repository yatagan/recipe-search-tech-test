Tzatziki
Introduction:
Add a little good quality olive oil or a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. As well as its usual use as a dip for pitta or veg, this makes a lovely, clean-flavoured salad dressing and is very good eaten with grilled lamb chops or chicken. 
Ingredients:
1 cucumber, peeled & finely diced 300ml Greek yoghurt 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Sprinkle cucumber with salt and leave in a colander for 30 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess moisture. Mix with Greek yoghurt, garlic cloves, finely chopped mint and some salt and pepper. Serve as part of a mezze, with olives, hummus and flatbreads.
