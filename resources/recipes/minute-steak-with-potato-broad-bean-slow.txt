Minute steak with potato, broad bean and slow roasted tomato salad
Introduction:
Apart from slow-cooking the tomatoes, which can be done well in advance, this delectable summer dinner takes only 20 minutes. If you don't have broad peas, use green or French beans instead. 
Ingredients:
12 cherry tomatoes, halved, or use a few semi-dried from a jar olive oil 300g broad beans, podded weight 900g new or salad potatoes, scrubbed clean & cut into bite sized pieces 2 tbsp olive oil for dressing 1 tsp balsamic vinegar small handful fresh herbs, chopped, e.g. chives, mint & basil 400-600g quick frying steak (minute steak) 20g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the oven to 120˚C/Gas ½. If using fresh tomatoes, place them cut side up on a non-stick baking tray and drizzle with a little olive oil. Season. Bake in the oven for 1 ½-2 hours, until softened and partly dried out. Remove and leave to cool. In a pan of boiling water, cook the broad beans for 3 minutes. Drain, refresh in cold water, then remove the outer skin (discard this) to leave the inner green bean. Put in a large bowl with the tomatoes. In a pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes until just tender (about 8 minutes). Drain, leave to cool slightly, then add to the bowl with the tomatoes and broad beans. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, herbs and season well. Gently toss together. Heat a large frying pan. Drizzle the steak with a little oil and season. Once the pan is very hot, fry for a couple of minutes on each side, then add a little knob of butter. Remove the steak from the heat once the butter is melted and has started to foam. Leave the meat to rest for a good couple of minutes, then serve with the potato salad.
