Easy ideas for spring greens
Introduction:
Spring greens are full of flavour and packed with vitamins C, E and K, iron, potassium, fibre and calcium. Don't discard the stems - just slice them more thinly than the green parts; they are actually sweeter than the leaf. 
Ingredients:
Spring greens
Method:
Buttered greens - Trim the base of the spring greens and chop roughly into pieces. Cook them in a pan of boiling water for about 4 minutes, until tender. Drain and toss with salt and pepper to season and add a large knob of butter. With pancetta or bacon - heat a little olive oil in a pan, and fry the bacon for a couple of minutes until browned. Add sliced spring greens and cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring continuously. Season with pepper. For a bit of added flavour try mixing some caraway seeds in with the greens, or some shredded wild garlic leaves. With chilli, garlic and soy - cut 2 or 3 bunches of greens into strips. Heat a little sunflower oil in a pan and stir fry the greens for about 2-3 minutes with a couple of chopped garlic cloves and one small fresh chilli, chopped (or chilli flakes). Add a couple of shakes of soy sauce just before serving. With diced chicken or pork - Heat some oil suitable for frying in a pan and add the chicken or pork. Fry on one side until coloured (about 3 minutes) then turn and smear with a little honey and mustard. Add some chopped fresh ginger, some sliced spring greens and a little lemon juice. Cook for another 3-5 minutes or until the meat is cooked through. Season, add some chopped parsley if you wish and serve with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes.
