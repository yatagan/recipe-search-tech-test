Middle Eastern cabbage salad
Introduction:
The classic Middle Eastern trio of mint, parsley and spring onions transforms raw cabbage into a a delicious and healthy salad. This vegan recipe works very nicely with both green cabbage and purple - just make sure to shred it fine and feathery. Let it stand for a few minutes before eating to give the cabbage time to soften slightly in the lemon juice. 
Ingredients:
Â½ medium cabbage (about 400g), very finely shredded 2-3 tomatoes, deseeded & diced 2-3 spring onions or 1 small regular onion, finely sliced handful flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped few fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped 2 tbsp olive oil juice of 1 lemon 1 small garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Combine the cabbage, tomatoes, onions and herbs. Combine the olive oil, lemon juice and garlic. Season and pour over the salad. Mix well and if possible leave to stand for 10-20 minutes before eating.
