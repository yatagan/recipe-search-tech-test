Roast colley with lemon, garlic and parsley crust
Introduction:
A bit like a fish finger, only much tastier; a quick and simple fish recipe.
Ingredients:
675g colley fillet 85g white breadcrumbs 3 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed zest of ½ lemon, finely grated 60g butter, melted squeeze lemon juice lemon wedges, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas Mark 8. Season the colley with salt and pepper to taste. Mix the breadcrumbs with the parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper, then add butter and lemon juice. Mix thoroughly with your fingers. Place the colley in a shallow, ovenproof dish and press the buttered crumbs firmly onto the colley to form an even crust. Bake for 25 minutes until the crust is browned and the fish just cooked through. Serve immediately, with lemon wedges.
