Jerusalem artichoke risotto
Introduction:
Puréed Jerusalem artichokes lend an intense earthiness to this easy-to-make risotto. It's good served with a grilled or fried Portobello mushroom on the side or a few smaller chestnut mushrooms. Or try it with pan-fried scallops or chicken breast. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, red or white, finely chopped 1 large garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped (optional) 300g risotto rice 200ml white wine (optional, or use more stock) 1-1.2 litre veg or chicken stock 2 tbsp cream cheese Jerusalem artichoke purée Parmesan, grated knob of butter (optional) small handful fresh parsley, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the olive oil in a pan and add the onion. Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until soft. Add the garlic if using and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the rice and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring, until the rice looks translucent. Add the wine and stir until it is absorbed. Gradually add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring all the time until it has been absorbed and the rice is tender (about 20 minutes or so). Stir in the cream cheese, Jerusalem artichoke purée, Parmesan to taste and butter if using. Season and add the chopped parsley if using.
