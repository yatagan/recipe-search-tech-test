Sweet potato, carrot and ginger soup
Introduction:
This is a health-giving cold weather soup with just the right balance of sweetness and punchy ginger – sunshine in a bowl. Serve it with a dollop of crème fraîche or yoghurt to serve if you have some. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 400g carrots, peeled & roughly chopped 400g sweet potato, peeled & roughly chopped 1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled & grated (use a little more if you prefer a hotter flavour) 1 litre veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and cook gently for 6-7 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the carrots, sweet potato and ginger. Stir together and cook for a minute or two. Add the stock, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Season well to taste. Blitz in a food processor until smooth.
