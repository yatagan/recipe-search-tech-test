Middle Eastern pickled turnips
Introduction:
Pickled turnips are omnipresent in the Middle East, often even at breakfast. Serve them as part of a mezze, or in pitta bread with salad, falafel and hummus, or simply on their own as a snack. The addition of beetroot gives the turnips a beautiful pink tinge â€“ but omit this step if you like. Leave the turnips to mature for about a week before consuming. 
Ingredients:
1kg turnips, peeled & quartered 2 beetroots, peeled & sliced 275ml white wine vinegar 3 garlic cloves 4 tbsp salt
Method:
In a couple of Kilner jars, layer the turnips with the beetroot slices. Put 1 litre water, vinegar, garlic and salt in a pan and heat gently until the salt has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the turnips and beetroot so they are completely covered, then seal the jars. The pickle will be ready for eating after about a week.
