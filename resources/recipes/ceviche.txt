Ceviche
Introduction:
This classic Central American dish makes a great canapé served in Little Gem lettuce leaves. Add sliced avocado and salad for a light, healthy lunch. The acid in the lime denatures the fish proteins a little as cooking would, but it's still important to use very fresh fish. 
Ingredients:
350g very fresh lemon sole fillets or other white fish 1 tsp salt juice of 4 limes (lemons will do but the result will not be as good) 2 red chillies, finely chopped (more if you like it hot) 1 garlic clove, crushed 3 tomatoes, finely chopped ½ red pepper, finely chopped ½ red onion, finely chopped ¼ cucumber, peeled, cut in half lengthways, then deseeded & finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped 1 tbsp olive oil
Method:
Skin the lemon sole fillets and slice them finely. Place in a shallow glass or ceramic dish, sprinkle with the salt and cover with the lime juice. Leave in the fridge for 1–1½ hours, until the fish looks opaque. Remove the fish from the juices and mix gently with the rest of ingredients in a bowl. It’s best served straight away but can be kept in the fridge for a few hours.
