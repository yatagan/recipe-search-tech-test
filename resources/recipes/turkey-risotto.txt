Turkey risotto
Introduction:
With its rich, creamy texture, this is a good way to resurrect the remains of a roast turkey dinner. It could also be made with goose or chicken. Try stirring in some fried mushrooms with the meat at the end. Serve with a green salad. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 onion, finely chopped 1 litre chicken or turkey stock 400g risotto rice splash white wine 300-500g cooked turkey 1 tbsp fresh mixed herbs, chopped 4 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
In a large heavy-based saucepan heat the oil and gently cook the garlic and onion until softened but not coloured (about 5 minutes). Meanwhile, in a separate pan bring the stock to a gentle simmer. Add the rice to the onion and garlic and stir until coated in oil. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the rice is translucent. Add the wine to the rice and cook until absorbed, then add a few spoonfuls of stock to the rice and stir well. Cook until most of the stock has been absorbed before adding another spoonful. Continue cooking and gradually adding stock until the rice is creamy but al dente (you may not need all the stock). Fold in the cooked turkey meat, fresh herbs and Parmesan. Season well and serve.
