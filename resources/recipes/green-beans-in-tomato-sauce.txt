Green beans in tomato sauce
Introduction:
With green beans there are three options: raw, very quick cooking, or slower cooking, as here, which brings out their sweet, almost caramel nature. This is a great dinner dish to serve with fresh water fish. Whatever else you eat it with, be sure to include bread, rice or potatoes to soak up the sauce. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 400-500g green beans, topped & tailed & cut into 4cm lengths 1 leek, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 bay leaf 400g tin Italian plum tomatoes a few basil leaves, torn salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a heavy based pan and sweat the beans and the leeks with the garlic and bay leaf for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, bring to simmer point and cook for 30 minutes or until beans are tender. Season, stir through the basil leaves and serve.
