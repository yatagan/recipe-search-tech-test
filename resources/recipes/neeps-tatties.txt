Neeps and tatties
Introduction:
Roughly mashed potatoes and turnips with salt, pepper and lashings of melted butter. This cosy side is traditionally served with haggis on Burns’ Night, but it's just as good on any other autumn evening with sausages and greens. 
Ingredients:
800g swede, peeled & cut into 2-3cm dice 800g potatoes, peeled & cut into 2-3cm dice 75g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the swede in a pan of salted water for 10 minutes. Add the potato. Boil for about 15 minutes, until both are tender (use two pans if you’ve not got one large enough). Drain. Coarsely mash together with a couple of large knobs of butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve in a large bowl, with another knob of butter on top to melt through.
