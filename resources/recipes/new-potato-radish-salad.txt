New potato and radish salad
Introduction:
Tender, waxy potatoes and crunchy fresh radishes. This is a quick and healthy version of potato salad. If you'd like it a little creamier, stir in a spoonful of crème fraîche. Add a few chopped gherkins for piquancy, and some grilled halloumi to make it a light lunch. 
Ingredients:
400-500g new potatoes, cleaned 4-5 tbsp olive oil 1-2 tbsp white wine vinegar 2-3 spring onions, green & white parts, finely sliced handful dill, fresh parsley or fresh mint or a combination, chopped 1 bunch radishes, washed, topped & tailed salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the potatoes until tender, about 10-12 minutes, then slice thickly. Combine olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and pour over potatoes while they are still warm. Add the spring onion and most of the herbs, reserving a few for garnish and gently mix through. If possible, leave the potatoes to infuse for a few hours before serving. When ready to serve, taste and adjust the dressing with more vinegar, seasoning etc if necessary. Finely slice the radishes and mix through. Sprinkle the salad with remaining herbs before serving.
