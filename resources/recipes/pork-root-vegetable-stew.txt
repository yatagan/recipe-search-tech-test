Pork and root vegetable stew
Introduction:
A good hearty stew for when it's cold and grey. Unlike most stews, this is ready in an hour. It uses as few extra ingredients as possible, and lots of them will be in the cupboard. Serve with rice, couscous or mash. It will freeze well if you have any leftovers. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 450g diced pork 1 onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed splash Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp tomato purée 2 sprigs thyme leaves, or 1 tsp dried 1 bay leaf 500g mixed root veg e.g. carrots, swede, celeriac, parsnips, peeled & cubed 1 tsp paprika 1 apple, cored & cut into chunks 500ml chicken or veg stock
Method:
Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole. Fry the pork in batches until browned. Remove each batch with a slotted spoon and keep to one side. Add the onion, reduce the heat and gently fry for 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and fry for a couple more minutes. Return the pork to the pan. Add the Worcestershire sauce, tomato purée, thyme, bay leaf, root veg, paprika, apple and stock. Bring the pan to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
