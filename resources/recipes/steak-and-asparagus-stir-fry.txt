Steak and asparagus stir-fry with jasmine rice
Introduction:
This is makes a speedy and delicious midweek dinner and is a good way of stretching a steak into a two-person meal. The key to any stir-fry with beef is not to overcook the meat; have all your ingredients chopped and ready and to go, and stop cooking while the meat's still tender and moist. This pairs well with egg noodles as well as rice. 
Ingredients:
200g jasmine rice 1 star anise 1 tbsp sesame seeds (we used black) oil for frying to a high temperature, e.g. sunflower 1 rump steak, cut into strips across the grain 200g asparagus, trimmed of their woody ends & cut in half 1cm fresh ginger, peeled & very finely sliced 1 small garlic clove, finely chopped 3 tbsp hoisin sauce 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely sliced length-ways 2 spring onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal salt
Method:
Put the jasmine rice and star anise in a small saucepan (one with a lid). Add a pinch of salt and 400ml water. Bring to the boil and cook for 5 minutes, then cover, remove from the heat and leave to steam for about 20-25 minutes, until the rice has absorbed the liquid and is soft and sticky. Remove the star anise. Put the sesame seeds in a dry wok or large frying pan and gently heat for 30 seconds-1 minute, stirring, until toasted. Tip onto a plate and keep to one side. Heat the oil in the wok (or pan) until smoking. Add the beef, asparagus, ginger and garlic and fry, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the hoisin and soy sauces. Stir for a minute to warm through, adding a splash of water if needed to thin the sauce. Throw over the sesame seeds, chilli and spring onions to serve, with the rice.
