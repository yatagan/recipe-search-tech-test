Courgette risotto
Introduction:
Courgette risotto is a cheap and delectable one-pot meal. All that's required for success is some dedicated stirring. Substitute the Parmesan for a vegetarian hard cheese if you like. Toasted pine nuts make a very nice garnish here, and so does crispily fried pancetta. This recipe would also welcome the addition of other light summer veg – asparagus, broad bean or peas. 
Ingredients:
600g courgettes 1 onion, chopped 75g butter 1.2 litres chicken or vegetable stock few leaves or sprigs fresh rosemary, thyme or marjoram 350g Arborio rice 2 medium-sized tomatoes, skinned, deseeded and chopped 1 large glass dry white wine 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 2 ½ tbsp Parmesan, grated (optional) & extra, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the courgettes into 1cm cubes discarding skin. In a heavy-based saucepan large enough to take all the ingredients with room to spare, cook the onion in half the butter until tender without browning. Meanwhile bring the stock to the boil in a separate pan. Turn the heat down as low as possible to keep hot, without actually boiling. Add the rosemary and courgette to the onion and stir for about a minute, before adding the rice. Continue stirring for another minute. Now add the tomatoes, wine, salt and pepper, and simmer, stirring, until the wine has evaporated. Add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot stock. Simmer, stirring, until the liquid has evaporated. Repeat until the rice is tender but still al dente. Stir in the remaining butter, parsley, Parmesan (if using) and more pepper and salt if needed. Let it sit for a minute or so, then serve with more Parmesan to hand round if you like.
