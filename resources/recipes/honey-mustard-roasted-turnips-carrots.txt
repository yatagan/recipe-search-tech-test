Honey and mustard roasted turnips and carrots
Introduction:
This is one of our favourite ways with root veg: roasted to intensify their flavour, then accented with a glaze of honey and mustard. It's a magnificent side to a Sunday roast or eaten on its own with couscous and a scattering of feta. You could also add parsnips, swede, celeriac or beetroot to the mix. 
Ingredients:
4-6 bunched carrots, trimmed & scrubbed 4 turnips, peeled & cut into wedges or large chunks 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar few sprigs of fresh thyme 2 tbsp clear honey salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut the carrots in half lengthways if large. Place in a baking dish, along with the turnips. Toss in the olive oil and vinegar. Season and scatter over the sprigs of thyme, then cover with foil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and toss in the honey. Roast, uncovered, for a further 15-20 minutes or so, until just tender.
