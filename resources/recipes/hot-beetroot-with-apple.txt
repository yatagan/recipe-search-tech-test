Hot beetroot with apple
Introduction:
Horseradish's formidable punch is a welcome balance to the sweetness of apple and beetroot in this fast and unusual side. It sits very well with roast pork, or, for vegetarians, would be good eaten with Puy lentils. 
Ingredients:
2 dessert apples 1 tbsp sunflower oil 25g butter 2 medium-sized cooked beetroot, peeled & diced into 1cm cubes 2 tbsp lemon juice ½ tsp creamed horseradish 1½ tbsp fresh parsley or fresh chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Just before cooking, core and cut the apples into quarters. Cut each quarter in half or thirds, depending on size. Heat the oil and butter in a frying-pan until it foams. Add the apple slices and fry briskly until golden brown. Scoop onto a serving plate, arranging them around the edges. Keep warm. Add the beetroot cubes to the pan and sauté briefly until hot. Pile them into the centre of the apples and keep warm. Quickly add the lemon juice and horseradish to the pan and stir, scraping in fat and juices. Pour over the beetroot. Season the whole lot with salt and pepper, scatter with herbs, and serve.
