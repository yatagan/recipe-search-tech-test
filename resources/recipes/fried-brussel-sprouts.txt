450g Brussels sprouts 2 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Shred the Brussels sprouts finely. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan and add the garlic and sprouts. Sauté over a moderate heat until the sprouts are light and patched with brown. Season and sprinkle with parsley.
