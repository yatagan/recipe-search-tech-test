Classic roast lamb
Introduction:
This makes an excellent weekend lunch, especially at Easter. Serve with potato gratin, or surround the lamb with peeled and thinly sliced potatoes and onions in a little stock and let them infuse with the meat juices during cooking. Drizzle the lamb in balsamic vinegar before cooking to give a caramelised tang.
Ingredients:
1.8kg leg of lamb 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 4 sprigs rosemary 8 anchovies, sliced lengthways (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Score the surface of the lamb in a diagonal fashion to create lattice lines down to the flesh. Then insert the garlic, rosemary and anchovies at the crossing points: a little tiresome but well worth it. Season the meat well, salt on the fat, pepper on the meat, and dust with a little flour. Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven to 170°C/Gas 3½ and cook for 3-3½ hours, until cooked to your liking. If the top looks like burning, cover with foil. Traditional roast lamb should be wrapped in foil and kept in a warm place for 20-30 minutes before carving to let the juices settle and tenderise the meat.
