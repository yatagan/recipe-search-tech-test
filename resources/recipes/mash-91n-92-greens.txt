Mash 
Introduction:
Lighter than the traditional mash, this greens-loaded dish is creamy, warming and comforting. It's good with chicken or sausages. Stir in a teaspoonful or more or mustard for a bit more of a kick. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & chopped ½ green or white cabbage, shredded 200g broccoli, cut into florets 30g butter 2 tbsp crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for about 10 minutes or until just tender. Meanwhile steam or braise the cabbage and broccoli for about 4 minutes. Drain and keep warm. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pan. Add the cabbage and broccoli. Season well, add a good knob of butter and lightly mash until just combined. Gently stir in the crème fraîche to serve. Check the seasoning. Reheat gently if necessary, to serve.
