Kohlrabi, orange and watercress salad
Introduction:
A healthy and unusual salad of mild, nutty kohlrabi, sweet orange and crisp watercress. This would be a good starter or accompaniment to a veg-filled tart. You could also try replacing the orange with a sweet, crunchy apple. Our kohlrabi comes into season in late May so make this in spring. 
Ingredients:
60ml sunflower oil 30ml olive oil zest of ½ & juice of 1 orange ½ tbsp ground fennel seeds, or to taste 1 tsp ground caraway seeds, or to taste lemon juice to taste 1 kohlrabi (2 if small) 2 oranges 100g watercress salt & pepper
Method:
Make the dressing by mixing together the oils, orange juice, zest and seeds, adding enough lemon juice, salt and spice to your own taste. Keep the black pepper and some of the spice mix for the end. Peel and halve the kohlrabi and slice thinly into half-moons or wedges. Leave them to steep in some of the dressing while you prepare the rest of the salad (or for up to an hour). Cut away the peel from the oranges, leaving no pith behind. Cut oranges into thin discs or segments (if segments, cut between them so no membrane is left). Wash the watercress in cold water, lift out and spin dry. Remove any particularly long or tough stems. Lightly dress the watercress with some of the dressing by tossing it in a big bowl. Build up the salad layer by layer on the serving platter, making it look as if it has been mixed. Drizzle with a bit more dressing and sprinkle some of the spice mix and black pepper over the top. If you like, serve extra dressing on the side.
