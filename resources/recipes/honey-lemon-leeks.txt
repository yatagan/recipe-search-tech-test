Honey and lemon leeks
Introduction:
As well as being a good side for chicken, these simple and delicious leeks are lovely served as a mezze dish. If you are eating them at cold, replace the cooking butter with olive oil and scatter with fresh herbs. 
Ingredients:
4 large or 6 small leeks 40g butter 2 tsp honey, preferably clear juice of ½ lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Wash and trim the leeks and cut into 1.5”- 2” lengths. In a large, heavy based pan with a lid, melt the butter then add the cut leeks and honey. Shake or stir to mix the honey with the leeks. Cover and place on a very low heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the leeks are soft but still hold their shape. Season with salt and pepper, with a good squeeze of lemon. Turn out onto a serving plate with the sticky juices.
