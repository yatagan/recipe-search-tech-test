Vegetables à la Grecque
Introduction:
Despite it's name, this cooking technique is entirely French. It's a light, healthy and versatile way of preparing summer vegetables. This can be served hot or cold, on its own or as an accompaniment to pâtés and cold meats. It will keep happily in the fridge for a week, making it a good dish to dip into. 
Ingredients:
600g vegetables - use just one type or a combination, for example: fennel, cut into quarters cauliflower, cut into florets leeks, cut into 3cm lengths celery hearts, split into sixths button mushrooms, halved 1 tbsp olive oil grated zest & juice of 2 lemons 1 onion, sliced 3 garlic cloves, crushed 8 coriander seeds ½ tsp fennel seeds 1 bay leaf a sprig of thyme a sprig fresh rosemary ½ tsp salt handful fresh parsley, chopped, to garnish (optional)
Method:
Place the prepared vegetables in a large pan with all the rest of the ingredients except the parsley. Add enough boiling water just to cover, then cover the pan and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender. Transfer to a serving dish and leave to cool. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before serving, if liked.
