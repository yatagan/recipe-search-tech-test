Stuffed vegetable barquettes
Introduction:
An extremely satisfying meal in one. Perhaps serve with some crusty bread to mop up the juices. 
Ingredients:
50g cooked ham, finely chopped 350g minced beef 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped 1 egg, beaten 3 tbsp Parmesan, grated 4 small squash, peppers or courgettes,cut in half, most flesh removed 2 tbsp each butter & olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 25g bacon lardons 4 tbsp passata 250ml dry white wine 50g breadcrumbs
Method:
Mix the ham, beef, parsley, egg and 2 tablespoons of Parmesan. Season and fill the veg shells. Heat the oil and butter in a pan, and gently cook the onion, garlic and lardons for 10 minutes. Add the stuffed vegetables (skin side down) and cook for a few more minutes. Mix the wine and passata and add to the pan. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Mix the breadcrumbs with the last tablespoon of Parmesan and sprinkle over the barquettes. Grill for 2-3 minutes until the top begins to brown. If you donâ€™t have a grill, switch your oven to maximum, cut the cooking time to 20 minutes, after which you sprinkle on the breadcrumbs and bake for a further 10 minutes. Spoon over the cooking juices and serve.
