Italian Bresaola
Introduction:
If you’ve ever thought about trying your hand at a bit of curing, this is one of the easiest places to start. Cured beef, like bacon, is the most utilitarian of products and a little goes a long way - whether eaten on its own, or added to salads and stews. Recipes always seem to call for enormous joints of beef, but smaller cuts are far more manageable and above all, quicker to cure and eat. The process is fairly lengthy, but the product is well worth it. 
Ingredients:
1 kg beef, trimmed of all fat & sinew 75g salt 1 bunch rosemary, chopped 1 tsp cloves 1 tsp crushed dried chillies 1 tbsp peppercorns 1 tbsp garlic, crushed (about 4 cloves) 12 bay leaves peel of ½ orange 150ml each red & white wine
Method:
Mix the dry ingredients - everything except the beef and wine - together and rub vigorously into the meat. Repeat an hour later with any leftovers. Place the joint in a plastic zip-lock bag, add the wine, seal and place in a container in the fridge. Leave for a week, turning daily. Remove from the bag, pat dry and hang in a cool dry place. If this is tricky, then just leave it exposed in the fridge. After a week it should be dry and noticeably firm. Brush with olive oil, wrap in greaseproof paper and leave in the fridge for another week. Eat thinly sliced like Parma ham. The downside of curing a small piece of meat is that you will get a higher percentage of dry bits around the outside, but you can treat these like bacon and use as a base for a soup or stew
