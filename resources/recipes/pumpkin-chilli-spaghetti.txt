Pumpkin and chilli spaghetti
Introduction:
A cheap and ebullient weeknight dinner, this is ready in half an hour. It can be made with any kind of pumpkin or squash, and if you don't fancy spaghetti, it's good with robust grains. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 large or 2 small onions (red or white), thinly sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 600g pumpkin or squash flesh, diced 2 chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 400g tin chopped tomatoes 300-400ml veg stock 350g spaghetti handful fresh parsley, chopped (optional)
Method:
In a large pan, heat the oil to a medium heat. Add the onion and fry gently until soft. Add the garlic and pumpkin and fry for a few minutes. Add the chillies, tomatoes and half the stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the pumpkin is tender. Add a little more stock as required during cooking, depending on which pumpkin or squash you are using (some are more watery than others). Meanwhile cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Drain and add to the pumpkin sauce. Add the chopped parsley if using and serve with grated Parmesan.
