Chargrilled courgette bruschetta
Introduction:
These smoky, herby toasts are a very good start to a barbecue. They're equally tasty cold, as warm. You could cook aubergine and peppers like this at the same time for tricolour bruschetta. Thin slices of mozzarella make a lovely addition. Leave out or substitute the Parmesan to make this vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
4 courgettes, washed & trimmed about 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp rosemary, oregano or marjoram leaves, finely chopped 4 large or 8 small (e.g. baguette size) slices chewy textured white bread 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 mild red chilli, deseeded & finely slivered (optional) 50g Parmesan, flaked or shaved using a vegetable peeler salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the courgettes into ribbons using a vegetable peeler, cutting lengthways down the courgette. Brush each slice very sparingly with olive oil. Heat a cast iron griddle or heavy frying pan until very hot. Grill the courgette slices in batches, turning so that both sides are striped by the griddle (or take a few brown spots if you are using a frying pan). Try not to overcook the courgette ribbons though, they are nice if they keep a bit of juiciness. Once all the slices are cooked, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss the herbs through. To make the bruschetta, toast both sides of the bread on the griddle (or use a toaster at a pinch). Rub one side of the toasted bread lightly with the garlic clove, followed by a trickle of olive oil. Pile the chargrilled courgette onto the bruschetta, add a few more drops of olive oil and the chilli slivers if using. Finish with a few flakes of Parmesan and serve.
