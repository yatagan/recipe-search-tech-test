Salad of French beans & grilled leeks with tapenade
Introduction:
An unusual take on salade Niçoise, this healthy salad is great with chicken or a meaty fish such as tuna. You could add a little shaved fennel before serving, if you like, or, if you're having it on its own as a light main, crumble over some feta. 
Ingredients:
300g french beans, trimmed 500g leeks, trimmed a little olive oil for the tapenade dressing: 75g stoned black olives 1 garlic clove 2 anchovy fillets 1 tsp capers, soaked in cold water for 20 mins, then drained & squeezed dry 1 fresh chilli (optional) 125ml olive oil 1 tbsp parsley or basil or tarragon, chopped (optional) freshly ground black pepper
Method:
First make the dressing. Put the olives, garlic, anchovies, capers and chilli, if using, in a food processor and whiz to a rough paste. Gradually add the olive oil and mix to make a dressing with a coating consistency. At this point the chopped herbs can be added. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Cook the french beans in boiling salted water for 3–4 minutes; they should still have some ‘bite’. Drain and set aside. Cook the leeks in boiling salted water for 5 minutes, then drain thoroughly. Cut them in half lengthways, toss in a little olive oil and then grill on a ridged grill pan until they are just tender and lightly charred. Cut into 6cm lengths. Mix the beans and leeks together and then stir in enough dressing to taste.
