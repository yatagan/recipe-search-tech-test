Spicy purple sprouting broccoli with garlic, olives and toasted breadcrumbs
Introduction:
Robustly spicy, this is lovely as a side to a roast, or eaten as a pasta sauce. It also works well with cauliflower or Calabrese broccoli (the normal kind) instead of purple sprouting. 
Ingredients:
100g breadcrumbs 75ml olive oil 600g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed 1 tbsp capers, rinsed & roughly chopped 4-6 anchovy fillets, chopped (optional) 6 garlic cloves, chopped ½ tsp fennel seeds pinch dried chilli flakes 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 4 tbsp black olives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Toss the breadcrumbs in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and spread them out on a baking tray. Bake for about 5 minutes, until golden. Remove and set aside. Break the purple sprouting broccoli into separate small heads, warm about 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a wide, shallow pan over a medium heat, add the broccoli and stir well. Leave to cook for about 10 minutes, until you see the edges browning slightly, then season to taste and stir gently. Add the capers, then cover and cook for about 5 minutes, until the broccoli is tender. Drizzle over the remaining olive oil and scatter with the chopped anchovies, if using, plus the garlic, fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Toss to mix in. Cook for 2 more minutes, then add the parsley and olives. Sprinkle with the toasted breadcrumbs and serve.
