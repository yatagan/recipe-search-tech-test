Roast turnip with Parmesan and thyme
Introduction:
Baked crisp and golden, the mild earthiness of this simple, aromatic turnip dish goes very well with chicken. For vegetarians, replace the Parmesan with Pecorino or another hard cheese. This recipe also work with sweet potatoes instead of turnips. 
Ingredients:
3-4 turnips, peeled 3 tbsp olive oil leaves from 5-6 sprigs thyme 3 tbsp Parmesan, grated few drops balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut the peeled turnips in half from top to bottom. Place cut side down and slice each half into 2-3mm pieces. Pile the pieces onto a large roasting tray, drizzle with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper and turn a few times to mix. Arrange the slices in a shallow, ideally single, layer on the tray and roast at for about 15-20 minutes until turnip is cooked and beginning to crisp and curl at the edges. You may need to turn the slices once or twice during cooking. Scatter over the thyme leaves followed by the Parmesan and return to the oven for about 5 minutes until Parmesan is golden. Transfer the turnips to a serving dish and sprinkle with a few drops of balsamic vinegar and more black pepper.
