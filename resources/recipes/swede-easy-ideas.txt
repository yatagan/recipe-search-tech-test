Ingredients:
Swede
Method:
Mashed swede & carrots: a classic combination. Boil cubes of peeled swede and carrots until tender, then mix with butter, a little milk or cream if you have some and plenty of salt and pepper. Swede chips: peel and cut into thick sticks, then toss in enough oil and melted butter to coat. Sprinkle with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and roast at 200°C/Gas 6 for 40-45 minutes, until cooked through and golden brown. Spice them up if you like, with cayenne, paprika, chilli powder, garam masala or medium curry powder. Roasted with maple syrup: peel and cut a swede into chunks and toss with 2 tablespoons oil, 3 tablespoons maple syrup and a grinding of salt and pepper. Roast at 200°C/Gas 6 for 40-45 minutes, until tender and caramelising. Serve alongside a roast, or with thick cut bacon, gammon or slow-cooked ham hock.
