Tomato & chorizo rice with green olives & spinach
Introduction:
This dish is like a beginner’s paella, no need for a specialist pan or rice. If rinsed well the rice won’t cloud the dish with starch and make it risotto-like. Be cautious with your seasoning in the early stages as the stock, chorizo and olives will all bring a saltiness with them.
Ingredients:
1 red onion 2 garlic cloves olive oil 1 vegetable stock cube 200g brown basmati rice 200g cooking chorizo 80g green olives 75ml white wine 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tin chopped tomatoes 200g spinach 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Put a kettle on to boil. Peel and finely slice the red onion. Peel and finely chop or crush 2 garlic cloves. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan and cook the onions on a medium heat for 5 minutes, until starting to soften. While the onions cook, measure out 350ml of hot water from the kettle and whisk in the stock cube until dissolved. Rinse the rice under cold running water in a sieve. Remove the skins from the chorizo and break each sausage into 10-12 pieces. Add the garlic and chorizo to the onions and cook for a further 3 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the olives into half’s. Tip in the thyme, wine and rice, cook for 2 minutes more. Add the chopped tomatoes, olives and stock. Bring to a simmer, season with a little salt and pepper and cook gently for 20 minutes, until the rice is plump and tender. While the rice cooks, put a pan of salted water on to boil. Wash the spinach and blanch it in the pan of boiling water for about 30 seconds, until it wilts. Drain and cool immediately in cold water. When the spinach is cold, drain and squeeze out as much water as you can with your hands. Roughly chop the squeezed spinach. When the rice has cooked, stir in the chopped spinach to warm through. Adjust the seasoning to your liking and serve in bowls with lemon wedges for squeezing.
