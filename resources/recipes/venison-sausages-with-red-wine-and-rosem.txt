Venison sausages with red wine & rosemary sauce
Introduction:
Venison sausages are good in all sorts of casseroles and cassoulets. De-skinned, they make a robust meat ragu - ideal for a simple supper. De-skinning is a doddle - hold under a cold tap for a few seconds, slit the skins and squeeze out the meat. 
Ingredients:
400g venison sausages, de-skinned 4 tbsp olive oil 250g red wine 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tsp finely chopped fresh rosemary 400g tin chopped tomatoes 4 tbsp chopped flat leaf parsley 400g pasta (ideally rigatoni)
Method:
Cut the sausage meat into chunks and fry in the olive oil, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Pour away any excess fat and add the wine. Allow to reduce for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, garlic and rosemary. Simmer for 20 minutes and season, adding a little water if it looks a bit dry. Cook and drain the pasta. Serve with the parsley and Parmesan.
