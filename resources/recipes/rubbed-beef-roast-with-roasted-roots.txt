Rubbed beef roast with roasted roots
Introduction:
Roasting your potatoes and roots around the joint will work a treat, providing the beef has plenty of fat. These days, in our pursuit of lean meat, this is rarely the case, but olive oil provides a good and healthier alternative. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves 1kg beef roast joint 4 potatoes, peeled 1 garlic clove 6-8 tbsp mayonnaise (laydilay is good) 1 tbsp parsley, chopped 2 sweet potatoes, peeled 4 carrots, peeled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/Gas Mark 4. Add some of the olive oil to the thyme and season well before rubbing over the joint. Cut the potatoes into chunks and toss in the remaining olive oil. Place in a roasting tray with the joint, sprinkle with salt and transfer to the oven. Blitz the garlic, mayonnaise and parsley in a mini processor and set aside. Cut the sweet potatoes and carrots into wedges and add them to the roasting pan after 20 minutes, turning in the oil before returning to the oven for a further 40 minutes. Rest the meat for a few minutes before carving and serving with the roasted roots and green mayo.
