Saffron, broad bean and new potato salad
Introduction:
This quick, light summer salad combines two of the best veg British summertime has to offer – bright emerald broad beans and waxy new potatoes. The saffron adds a gently sweet, aromatic taste that brings the dish together beautifully. This goes well with grilled mackerel or chicken. 
Ingredients:
800g new potatoes, scrubbed & cut in ½ or ¼ if large a good pinch of saffron threads 500g broad beans in their pods 4 tbsp olive oil juice of ½ lemon, to taste 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cover the potatoes in water. Add the saffron and a good pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Simmer for 12-15 minutes, until tender. While the potatoes are cooking, bring another pan of water to the boil. Pod the beans and add them to the pan. Boil for 3 minutes, drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. If the beans are large, you might want to double pod them, but there’s no need if they’re small and the skins are tender. Drain the potatoes then add them to the beans and toss in the oil and season. Add lemon juice to taste. Toss in the parsley to serve.
