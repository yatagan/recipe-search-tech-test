Two garlic chicken risotto
Introduction:
With the inclusion of wild garlic in this recipe, you get the depth of flavour of the bulb version and the spring walk in the woods fragrance, cooked for just long enough to lose its tendency to overpower for days to come. 
Ingredients:
1 chicken thigh 1 chicken leg 3 tbsp olive oil 150ml white wine 1 onion, thinly sliced 50g wild garlic, stems & leaves separated, leaves roughly chopped 1 thyme sprig slice lemon 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 150g arborio rice 600ml chicken stock 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated 30g chilled butter, diced
Method:
Fry the chicken in 1 tablespoon of oil until evenly brown all over. Transfer to a saucepan, add the stock and bring to a simmer. Allow the pan to cool a little and deglaze with 50ml of the wine. Pour off and retain the liquid. In a heavy saucepan, add the onion, wild garlic stems, thyme, lemon slice, chopped garlic cloves and a pinch of salt to the pan and sweat for 5 minutes. Add the rice, stir to give it a good coating and add the remaining wine. Allow to cook until the wine has been absorbed or evaporated. Add the juices from the pan and the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring frequently until the rice is cooked but still fairly firm to the bite. When the stock is nearly all gone, remove the chicken and scrape/cut the meat from the bone. Trim and shred. Add the wild garlic leaves to the risotto and cook for 5 more minutes until well wilted. Keep stirring. Return the chicken to the risotto pan for a couple of minutes to reheat. Add the Parmesan and butter, stir and serve.
