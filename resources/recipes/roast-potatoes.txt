Roast potatoes
Introduction:
For the best roast potatoes, use floury varieties, as they are starchier and make for a fluffier roast. If you are roasting a joint of meat at the same time, you may have the heat a little lower. That’s fine – just cook the potatoes for slightly longer than stated here. They will always keep warm quite happily on a lower oven shelf while you finish the rest of the meal. 
Ingredients:
800g-1kg potatoes, depending on how greedy you are 6 tbsp fat, ideally goose or duck fat, or olive oil coarse sea salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 8. Put the fat or oil in a roasting dish and place in the oven to heat up. Peel your potatoes and cut them into even sized chunks. Don’t make the chunks too small, 3 for a large potato, two for a small-medium potato is usually fine. Leave the very small ones whole. In a large pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes for 8 minutes. Drain and leave to steam for a minute, then roll the potatoes around in the colander until they start to fluff up around the edges. Carefully tip the potatoes into the hot fat. Use a large spoon to baste them all over with the hot fat and sprinkle liberally with salt. Roast for 50 minutes–1 hour at 200°C/Gas 6 until golden and crispy.
