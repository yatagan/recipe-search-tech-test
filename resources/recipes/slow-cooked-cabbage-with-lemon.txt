Slow-cooked cabbage with lemon
Introduction:
This cabbage dish is very simple to make and goes well with sausages, ham, or slow-cooked pork. The lemon brightens this winter vegetable and bring out its natural sweetness. 
Ingredients:
1kg white cabbage 1 lemon 75g lightly salted butter 2 tsp sugar salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the cabbage into strips about 1cm wide, discarding the tough core. Pare the zest from the lemon in wide strips and squeeze out the juice. Melt the butter in a saucepan large enough to take all the cabbage. Add cabbage, lemon zest, sugar, salt and pepper. Turn to mix, then cover tightly and cook over a low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally until the cabbage is meltingly tender and all the liquid it has exuded has been reabsorbed or evaporated. If it still seems a little watery after an hour, remove the lid and let it bubble quietly for another 5-10 minutes. Add the lemon juice, cover and cook for a few minutes longer. Adjust seasoning.
