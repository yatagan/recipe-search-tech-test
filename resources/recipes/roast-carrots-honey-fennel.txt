Roast carrots with fennel and honey
Introduction:
This is a simple side dish that works particularly well with roast pork – both honey and fennel are great partners for the pig. If you are a fennel fan, rub crushed fennel seeds into the scored pork skin (with the salt) to make fantastic, aniseed crackling.
Ingredients:
1kg carrots, peeled 2–3 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil 1½ tsp fennel seeds 4 tbsp honey good pinch salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the carrots into long wedges or roll-cut them into angular pieces. If they are small and slender, leave them whole or cut them in half length-ways. Toss with the oil, fennel seeds, honey and salt. Spread the carrots in a single layer over a roasting pan lined with baking paper. Roast for around 30 minutes until cooked through and caramelising in places – check after 20 minutes and turn over to ensure even roasting. Serve hot or warm.
