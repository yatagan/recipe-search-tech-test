Oven baked bubble and squeak
Introduction:
Oven-roasting your bubble and squeak uses less oil and also means you don't have to stand over a hot pan flipping individual patties. Add any leftover roasted squash or beetroot. This makes for a good vegetarian brunch or weeknight dinner, with a fried or poached egg on top (and maybe a sausage or two for the meat eaters). 
Ingredients:
400g mashed potatoes 200g cooked green veg e.g. Savoy, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, roughly chopped butter cheese, grated (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Grease a baking dish with butter. Mix the potato and greens together and season well with salt and pepper. Press into the baking dish and dot with a little extra butter, some cheese too if you like. Bake for 20 minutes or so until golden brown on top. Serve with grilled tomatoes, bacon or baked beans!
