Turnip fries
Introduction:
Turnip chips make a fun alternative to classic French fries. The mild nuttiness of turnips pairs well with paprika – although you could also try roasting them with nutmeg and grated Parmesan; or chopped rosemary, garlic and lemon zest. Eat them in any of the places you'd normally have potato chips. 
Ingredients:
1kg turnips, peeled & cut into French fry size chips 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1-2 tsp paprika salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 8. Line a baking tray or dish with a piece of foil and brush with a little oil. Place the turnips in a large bowl. Toss with the vegetable oil, paprika, salt and pepper to coat. Spread out onto the baking tray. Bake in the oven until the outside is crispy, and the inside is tender, about 20-30 minutes.
