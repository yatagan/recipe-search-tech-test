Massaman curry paste
Introduction:
Obviously you can buy massaman curry paste, but if you're starting from scratch here's how to do it. Makes 1 jar. 
Ingredients:
12 dried red chillies 12 garlic cloves, peeled 3 lemongrass stalks, tough outer layers removed & thinly sliced 3 medium shallots, thinly sliced 3cm piece galangal or ginger, peeled & thinly sliced 1 tbsp vegetable oil 6 whole cardamom pods 6 whole cloves 3cm piece cinnamon stick 2 tbsp coriander seeds 2 tsp cumin seeds 3 star anise stems from large bunch of coriander 50g salted dry-roasted peanuts ½ tsp each ground nutmeg, turmeric & salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Soak the chillies in warm water in a small bowl for 15 minutes, then drain and pat dry. Toss the chillies, garlic, lemongrass, shallot, and galangal/ginger with oil in a baking tray and roast for 4-5 minutes. Give the tray a good shake and return to the oven until the chillies are golden brown. Allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine the ‘Cs’ (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, coriander and cumin) and star anise in a small frying pan and toast over medium heat for 2 or 3 minutes, until fragrant. Allow to cool. Gently crush the cardamom pods to remove the seeds and discard as much pod as possible, then grind the spices in a spice mill, or with a mortar and pestle. Next, blitz everything to a coarse paste in a food processor and transfer to a clean jar. It will keep for several weeks in the fridge.
