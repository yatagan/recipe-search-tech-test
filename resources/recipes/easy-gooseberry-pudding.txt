Easy gooseberry pudding
Introduction:
This gooseberry dessert couldn't be simpler to make and is a lovely end to a summer meal: tart-sweet gooseberries set off by unctuous crème fraîche and counterbalanced by the slight spice and texture of the gingery biscuits. 
Ingredients:
300g gooseberries, topped & tailed 50g caster sugar 250g crème fraîche 150g gingernut biscuits, crushed 30g butter, melted
Method:
Place the gooseberries in a saucepan with a tablespoon of water. Cover and simmer gently until soft, about 10 minutes. Leave to cool, then add the sugar to taste - you may want slightly more depending on how tart the gooseberries are. You can sieve or blend the gooseberries if you want a smooth pudding, or just mash roughly with a fork or not at all if you want more texture. Mix the cooked, sweetened gooseberries with crème fraîche and then layer in a serving bowl or individual glasses with crushed gingernut biscuits mixed with a little melted butter.
