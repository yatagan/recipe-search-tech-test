Celeriac three ways
Introduction:
Brute in appearance but delicate and aromatic in the tasting. Give it a good scrub then set to it with a knife to carve away the knobbly skin and roots.
Ingredients:
celeriac
Method:
Remoulade: The signature raw preparation. Peeled, coarsely grated or cut in to fine matchsticks and mixed with good quality mayonnaise or crème fraîche, spiked with a squeeze of lemon and dab of mustard. Braised: Peel and cut into 2cm cubes. Fry on a high heat in a saucepan for a few minutes before adding a dash of cider vinegar, a walnut sized lump of butter and ½ a glass of stock. Cover tightly and braised for 20 minutes, Stir well and make sure it doesn’t catch or burn. With a spud: Try combining 50/50 with you potatoes in a mash or gratin. For the mash boil them separately and puree the celeriac before folding it into the mashed spuds. Bake them together in a traditional gratin with garlic and cream and a healthy blob of whole grain mustard rippled through.
