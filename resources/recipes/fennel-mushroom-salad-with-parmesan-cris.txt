Fennel and mushroom salad with Parmesan crisps
Introduction:
An elegant salad of crisp fennel and earthy mushrooms topped with fragments of crunchy cheese. If you're a vegetarian use Pecorino rather than Parmesan for the crisps. This does well with a little drizzle of truffle oil for finish if you're lucky enough to have it. 
Ingredients:
100g Parmesan 100g mixed salad leaves or watercress 1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed & sliced very finely (use a mandolin if you have one) 200g mushrooms, thinly sliced juice of 1 lemon 3 tbsp olive oil handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
To make the Parmesan crisps: Preheat the grill. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Use a sharp knife or mandolin to slice the cheese very thinly. Carefully place the slices on the baking sheet. Place under the grill until just bubbling and golden (keep an eye on them). Leave to cool. Lift off carefully with a pallet knife when needed. In a large bowl, toss the salad leaves, fennel, mushrooms, lemon juice, olive oil and parsley together. Season to taste. Arrange on a large plate and sprinkle over the Parmesan crisps just before serving.
