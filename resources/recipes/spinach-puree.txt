Spinach purée
Introduction:
This quick vegetarian side is great with anything from grilled fish to lamb, rabbit or halloumi cut into slices and griddled. You'll need to add more spinach to your box for this, as you need quite a lot. For a less tangy finish try using ricotta instead of crème fraîche, or for a lighter one, replace it with yoghurt. 
Ingredients:
1kg spinach 60g butter, cubed 4 tbsp crème fraîche ½ tsp nutmeg, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Wash 1kg of spinach leaves and wilt in a large pan with just the water clinging to the leaves. Plunge into cold water, then drain and squeeze with your hands to remove any excess liquid. Put in a pan with 60g of cubed butter, stirring until melted.Stir in crème fraîche and nutmeg. Season to taste. Purée until smooth.
