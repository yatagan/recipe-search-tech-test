Red flannel hash
Introduction:
This sweet, earthy hash is very quick and simple. It makes a good brunch or midweek supper, especially with a fried egg perched on top. This is meant to be rustic and hearty â€“ the quantities aren't very important: add more or less potato or beetroot; use sweet potato instead or potato; throw in some lardon of cooked bacon or chorizo, or some shredded cabbage or Brussels sprouts. 
Ingredients:
350g tin corned beef, diced 1 onion, finely chopped 450g cooked potatoes, peeled & diced 275g cooked beetroot, peeled & diced 50g butter 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Mix together the corned beef, onion, potatoes, beetroot and a little salt and pepper. If you have the time, leave for a few hours or even overnight, covered, stirring occasionally. This is not essential, but it improves the flavour. Let the butter in a wide, heavy frying-pan and heat until it is foaming. Add the corned beef mixture and the Worcestershire sauce. Stir, then press down fairly firmly. Turn the heat down to medium-low and cook gently for about 15 minutes until a brown crust forms on the base. Stir and break up, so that some of the crust gets mixed in with the rest. Add about 4 tablespoons of hot water. Press down again and cook for a further 15 minutes or so, until a second crust has formed. Scoop out on to a dish, scatter with parsley and serve immediately.
