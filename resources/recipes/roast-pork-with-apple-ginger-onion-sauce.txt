Roast pork with apple, ginger and onion sauce
Introduction:
A very good recipe for a weekend or celebratory meal. For heavenly gravy, sit the joint over a couple of split leeks - they will brown and impart both colour and flavour and may be discarded after making the sauce. Because the pork and crackling are so deliciously sweet and rich this simple apple sauce works well as a sharp foil for it. 
Ingredients:
1.1kg pork roast sea salt 25g butter 1 small onion, chopped 3cm fresh ginger. peeled & finely grated runny honey, to taste 1 large Bramley apple, peeled, cored & cut into small dice salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Rub salt over the skin of the pork and roast for 10 minutes then drop the oven temperature to 180°C/Gas 4 for the rest of roasting time (which is as a guide - 30minutes/450g plus 30 minutes, but it will also depend on thickness of the joint so test after 1 hour 15 minutes and then continue if not cooked). Rest for 10 minutes in a warm place before carving. For the sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan and sweat the onion and ginger together for a few minutes. If you find the sauce too sharp then add a touch of honey to taste. Add the diced apple and turn in to the mixture with seasoning. Cover and cook until the apple has become a purée.
