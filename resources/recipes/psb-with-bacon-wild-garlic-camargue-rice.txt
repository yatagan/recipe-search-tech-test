purple sprouting broccoli with bacon, wild garlic and carmague rice
Introduction:
If you can’t get hold of any camargue red rice (it is available in larger food shops and health food shops), which has a good nutty flavour, then use brown basmati or a mixture of brown and wild rice.
Ingredients:
1 litre veg stock (or water) 200g camargue red rice, rinsed & drained 250g purple sprouting broccoli 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely sliced 8 slices smoked streaky bacon, finely chopped (use scissors for ease) 6-8 leaves wild garlic, shredded (if you can't forage for wild, use a clove or two of finely chopped dried garlic) splash sherry or balsamic vinegar juice of ½ lemon 50g hazelnuts, toasted in the oven or a frying pan, skins rubbed off, roughly chopped olive oil, for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
In a large saucepan heat the stock/water until boiling and add the rice. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30-35 minutes, until the rice is just tender. Drain and keep to one side. Blanch or steam the broccoli for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh in cold water, then drain again. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and bacon, fry for a few minutes, until the bacon is just cooked. Add the wild garlic leaves and fry for a couple more minutes. Add the psb, rice, vinegar and lemon juice, season with salt and pepper to taste and toss together to combine. Serve topped with the hazelnuts and a drizzle of olive oil.
