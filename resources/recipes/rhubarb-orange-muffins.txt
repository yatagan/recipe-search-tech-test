Rhubarb and orange muffins
Introduction:
These easy-to-make muffins are moist and not overly sweet, hefty but not heavy. They're great as a fruity snack, or for breakfast if you tone down the sugar a little and replace 100g of the plain flour for whole wheat. Try with cinnamon, or with apple substituted for some of the rhubarb. 
Ingredients:
300g plain flour ½ tsp baking powder 250g caster sugar 1 tsp cinnamon (optional) 300-400g rhubarb, finely diced grated zest of 1 orange 2 eggs, beaten 200ml milk 100g butter, melted
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6 and line a 12 hole muffin tin with paper cases. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder and cinnamon if using. Mix in the finely diced rhubarb and orange zest. Beat eggs with milk and melted butter. Combine wet and dry ingredients and spoon mix into the muffin cases. Sprinkle the tops with demerara or brown sugar and bake for 25-30 minutes.
