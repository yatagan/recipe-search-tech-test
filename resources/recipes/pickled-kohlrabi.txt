Pickled kohlrabi
Introduction:
Kohlrabi has a unique crisp, fresh taste when raw, but can get lost in a crowd of other flavours, tending to offer more texture than taste. Turning kohlrabi into a pickle with a few aromatics lends it a sharper edge and is a good way to use up the whole piece in one go. It also extends the shelf life. At its most basic, the pickling liquid can be made with just the water, vinegar, honey, and salt – so vary the herbs and spices as you like.
Ingredients:
1 large kohlrabi 250ml white or red wine vinegar 1 tbsp sea salt 1 tbsp honey 1 garlic clove, thinly sliced 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 fresh chilli or ½ dried chilli, sliced 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 2 bay leaves
Method:
Peel the kohlrabi, slice thinly, and cut the slices into fine matchstick-thin shreds (or use a mandolin). Put the vinegar, salt and honey in a pan with 250ml water and bring to the boil. Mix the kohlrabi with the remaining ingredients in a bowl and then pack into a sterilised preserving jar. Tip the hot liquid over them, making sure it reaches the top of the jar and covers everything. Close the lid and allow to cool. Keep in the fridge and use within a couple of weeks. It is best left for at least 3 days before eating.
