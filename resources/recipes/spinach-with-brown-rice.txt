Spinach with brown rice
Introduction:
Wholesome and flavourful, this is a great standalone, one-pot supper. For a crustier finish, melt a little butter in a pan, mix in some breadcrumbs and a little cayenne, then spread on top before baking. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped 85g butter 250g brown rice 600g spinach, rinsed & chopped 100g Cheddar, grated 2-3 eggs, beaten
Method:
Fry the onion for a few minutes in 60g of butter in a heavy bottomed pan. Add the brown rice and stir to cover it with butter. Add twice the volume of boiling water (as the rice). Simmer until the rice is almost done (about 40 minutes). Stir in the spinach, cheese and eggs (easier with your hands than a spoon). Transfer to a buttered baking tray and cook in a moderate oven for about 30 minutes.
