Lamb steaks with quince membrillo
Introduction:
'The best lamb steaks are cut from individual leg muscles - that way there is no connective tissue and the grain and texture of the steak will be the same throughout.' (Ben Watson) The perfumed sweetness of quince membrillo goes brilliantly with rosy lamb. Make your own membrillo or buy it from a good deli. 
Ingredients:
8 shallots, thinly sliced sprig of rosemary 4 garlic cloves olive oil 25g butter 4 lamb steaks 200ml chicken or beef stock 4 tbsp cream 40g quince jelly or paste or membrillo (if itâ€™s very stiff, soften in a little warm water). lemon juice, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
First slowly cook the shallots, rosemary and whole garlic in a little olive oil until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve. Add half of the butter to the pan and raise the heat to fry off the lamb steaks to brown on both sides and be cooked to your taste (about 3-4 minutes each side and they will still be pink), remove and rest in a warm place whilst you make the sauce. Add the remainder of the butter to the pan, return the cooked shallots and garlic together with the stock, turn up the heat and reduce to a syrup. Now stir in the cream and quince jelly to amalgamate. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding a few drops of lemon juice to taste and spoon over the lamb steaks.
