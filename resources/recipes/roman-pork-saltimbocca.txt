Roman pork saltimbocca
Introduction:
Traditionally made with veal, though we prefer altogether more principled pork, saltimbocca is a delicious, decadent and extremely quick dish, perfect for when you feel like something special but haven't got the time to slave over the stove. Serve with a salad or some wilted greens. 
Ingredients:
4 pork steaks 4 slice prosciutto, parma ham or jamon serrano 8 sage leaves 150ml dry white wine 50g butter
Method:
Using a rolling pin, gently tap out the pork steaks to a thickness of about 5mm. Place a slice of ham and a couple of sage leaves flat on each one, securing with cocktail sticks. Youâ€™ll have to bend the pork a little, but keep it as flat as possible. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a fairly high heat and fry the pork, sage and ham face-down for a couple of minutes. Hold down with the back of a spatula or wooden spoon. Turn over and fry for another two minutes. Remove to a warm plate, add the wine to the pan to deglaze and quickly reduce to a syrup. Spoon over the pork and serve.
