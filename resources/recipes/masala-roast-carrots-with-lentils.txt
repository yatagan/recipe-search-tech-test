Indian masala roast carrots with coconut red lentils & flatbreads
Introduction:
The sweet earthy qualities of the humble carrot make it an ideal vehicle for a whole world of spices. Set against this simple dahl-like bowl of lentils they are best roasted with a little bite left to them.
Ingredients:
500g carrots, peeled & chopped into angled pieces 6 shallots, peeled & quartered 1 tbsp garam masala oil for frying & roasting 1 chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled & finely chopped 1 tsp black mustard seeds 1 tbsp curry leaves 2 tbsp medium curry powder 150g red lentils, rinsed well 400ml tin coconut milk 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped 4 flatbreads 1 bunch coriander, leaves & stalks chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220ËšC/Gas Mark 8. Place the carrots and shallots in a roasting tin, add the garam masala and 2 tablespoons of oil. Season well and roast for 25 minutes, until the carrots are tender but toothsome and coloured at the edges. Turn once or twice during cooking. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in the saucepan and add the halved chilli, garlic, mustard seeds and curry leaves. Fry gently for 1 minute until the mustard seeds start to pop. Tip in the curry powder, lentils, coconut milk, tomatoes and 150ml of water. Bring the lentils to the boil, spoon off any scum that rises to the surface and leave to simmer for about 25 minutes, until the lentils have softened. Add more water if they start drying out; you want a loose, porridge-like consistency. Put a frying pan on a medium high heat. Brush the flatbreads with a little oil on both sides. Cook them in the pan, one at a time, until lightly coloured on both side. They should take about 1 minute each. When the lentils have cooked, season them well to taste. Fold in half the chopped coriander. Serve the lentils in a shallow bowl. Spoon the roasted carrots and shallots on top and finish with the remaining coriander and the warm flatbreads.
