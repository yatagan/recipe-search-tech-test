Purple sprouting broccoli pasta with gremolata
Introduction:
A quick, fresh vegetarian pasta dish. Gremolata is a mixture of finely chopped lemon zest, parsley and raw garlic. It is traditionally used to garnish ossobucco, but is very good with veggies. Outside the purple sprouting broccoli season you can make this with ordinary broccoli. 
Ingredients:
2 or 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1-2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 2 unwaxed lemons 400g purple sprouting broccoli 400g pasta (farfalle would be good) 2 tbsp olive oil 2 courgettes, diagonally sliced olive oil, to drizzle salt & pepper
Method:
To make the gremolata, put the garlic and parsley in a small bowl, add the finely grated rind of the 2 lemons, and a little of the lemon juice. Season and set aside. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the psb for 2-3 minutes, until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon, bring the water back to the boil, and add 400g pasta, cooking it according to the instructions on the packet. Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a frying pan, and fry two sliced courgettes until they start to turn golden. Add the purple sprouting broccoli and cook for another minute. When the pasta is cooked, drain, reserving a couple of spoonfuls of the cooking liquid. Toss the pasta and cooking liquid with the vegetables, gremolata and seasoning. Serve drizzled with a little good olive oil.
