Cabbage three ways
Introduction:

Ingredients:
cabbage
Method:
Fresh sauerkraut: Although lacking the savoury depth of the fermented form you can approximate the key notes by braising half a shredded cabbage with, 300ml of apple juice, 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, 4 smashed juniper berries and generous grind of black pepper. Great with bangers and mash. Comfort: Blanch sliced cabbage in salted boiling water for 3 minutes and stir into buttery mashed potato to make some Irish colcannon, or add to cold mash and chopped leftovers, form into little patties and fry until golden brown for a take on bubble & squeak. Leeks and bacon: Cabbage and pork always go. Try frying chopped bacon or lardons until crispy. Add a leek and quarter cabbage, finely sliced. Cook gently in the bacon fat until soften, about 10 minutes.
