Kale, chorizo and potato hash
Introduction:
A quick brunch, lunch or dinner. This gives a wonderful range of textures and flavours from hardly any ingredients. It's especially good topped with a fried or poached egg. You can substitute cabbage or Brussels sprouts for kale here, and cooked chicken or corned beef for the chorizo. Sweetcorn is another good addition. 
Ingredients:
300g kale 1 tbsp olive oil 300g chorizo sausage, chopped 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 500g cooked potatoes, cut into 2cm dice salt & pepper
Method:
Strip the kale leaves from their central ribs and blanch them in a large pan of boiling salted water for 1 minute. Drain well, refresh in cold water and drain again. Squeeze out excess water and chop roughly. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the chorizo and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes, until just starting to brown. Remove the chorizo with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion and garlic to the chorizo fat in the pan and cook gently for 5 minutes. Add the diced potatoes, turn up the heat to get some colour in them and cook for 5 minutes, turning the potatoes until browned all over. Return the chorizo to the pan with the kale and cook slowly for another 10 minutes, until well mixed and thoroughly heated through. Season and serve.
