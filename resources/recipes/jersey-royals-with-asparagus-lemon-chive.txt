Jersey Royals with asparagus and lemon and chive mayo
Introduction:
This recipe is best with Jersey Royals, which are in season in spring and early summer and have a waxy texture and a subtle taste. This recipe is even better if you have time to make your own mayonnaise. Try it with poached salmon or sea trout, or grilled chicken. 
Ingredients:
250g mayonnaise juice of Â½ lemon handful chives, chopped 24 Jersey Royals 12 asparagus spears
Method:
In a bowl mix together the mayonnaise, lemon juice and chopped chives. Cook the Jersey Royals by boiling them in slightly salted water for about 10-12 minutes or until tender. While they are cooking steam or boil the asparagus spears in another pan until just tender (about 3 minutes). Drain both the potatoes and the asparagus, then once cooled mix with the mayonnaise. Serve with fish or chicken.
