Pommes de terres Girondines
Introduction:
These are fine rustic potatoes from La Gironde in south west France – crisp on the outside with tender, yielding centres. They're fairly quick to make, very inexpensive. They are a filling weeknight supper with just a salad or some sautéed greens on the side. For a more extended feast, try this with duck or chicken. 
Ingredients:
750g potatoes 100g smoked streaky bacon, diced 2 garlic cloves, halved 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 2 tbsp white wine vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the potatoes and rinse in cold water. Slice thinly. Find a heavy frying-pan or wide pan into which the potatoes will just fit neatly. Press the potatoes into the pan, add enough water to half cover, and season lightly with salt. Cover and cook over a fairly high heat for 12 minutes or so, until the potatoes are just cooked. Meanwhile, fry the bacon slowly so that it begins to release its own fat. Once there's a thin layer of fat on the base of the pan, add the garlic. Continue to cook over a gentle heat, until the bacon has given up all its fat and is beginning to brown. Draw off the heat and wait until the potatoes are done. Once the potatoes are cooked drain off any excess water and return to the heat. Re-heat the bacon in its fat until it begins to smoke. Fish out the garlic and discard. Pour bacon and fat evenly over the cooked potatoes, still in their pan and add the parsley, pepper and vinegar. Stir gently to mix and serve.
