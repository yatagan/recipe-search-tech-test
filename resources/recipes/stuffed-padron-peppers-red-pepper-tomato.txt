Stuffed padron peppers with red pepper and tomato dip
Introduction:
Padron peppers (pimientos de padrón) originally hail from Galacia but we’ve discovered they also like growing on our farm in France. Some are hot and some are not – it's impossible to tell which is which. Serve these vegetarian stuffed peppers with their bold, creamy dip and cold beers, or as a starter. 
Ingredients:
1 red pepper 4 tomatoes 2 cloves garlic splash sherry vinegar brown sugar, for sprinkling 2 tbsp crème fraîche (or plain yoghurt) handful fresh basil leaves, shredded olive oil 200g padron peppers 100g High Weald soft sheep’s cheese salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. First make the dip: Put the red pepper, tomatoes and unpeeled garlic in a small baking dish. Splash over a little of the vinegar and sprinkle with a little sugar, salt and pepper. Bake for about 30-40 minutes, until the pepper skin is blackening and the tomatoes very soft. Put the pepper in a small freezer bag for 10 minutes, then remove and peel off the skin, scrape out the seeds and discard. Put the pepper flesh in a food processor with the tomatoes, garlic (remove the skins) and any juices in the baking dish. Add the crème fraîche and blitz until smooth. Check the seasoning, adding a little more vinegar too if needed. Put in a bowl and scatter over the basil leaves. Grind some extra black pepper over the top and drizzle over a little olive oil to serve. Carefully make a length-ways slit in each pepper. Stuff each pepper with the cheese and press the slits together to close. Heat just enough oil to coat a heavy based frying pan. Fry the peppers until they are blistering and wilting slightly. Remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper. Serve with the dip.
