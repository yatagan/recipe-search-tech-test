Venison, kale & mushroom stroganoff
Introduction:

Ingredients:
125g brown basmati rice 200g venison steaks, sliced into strips oil for frying 2 shallots, peeled & finely sliced ½ head black kale (approx. 100-150g), leaves stripped from their stalks & shredded 2 portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced 1 tsp paprika ½ tsp smoked paprika 100ml white wine 150ml crème fraîche 1 lemon 1 tbsp chopped dill leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Boil a kettle of water. Rinse the rice in a sieve. Transfer to a saucepan with a good pinch of salt. Add plenty of boiled water. Bring to the boil and cook until the rice is just tender, approx. 20-25 mins. Drain once cooked (N.B. you’ll need to start frying off the venison for the stroganoff after 15 mins). Season the venison. Once the rice has been cooking for 15 mins, heat 1 tbsp oil in a frying pan. When the pan is very hot, stir-fry the venison for approx. 1 min or so, to seal and brown them. Transfer to a plate. Lower the pan heat slightly. Add a splash more oil, the shallots, kale and mushrooms. Stir-fry on a medium heat for approx. 3-4 mins, until the mushrooms have softened. Add the venison back to the pan. Stir-fry for 1 more min. Add both the paprikas, then the wine. Let the mixture bubble until the wine is almost all absorbed. Add the crème fraîche. Let it gently bubble for a couple of mins to thicken the sauce. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and season to taste. Stir in the dill. Serve with the cooked and drained rice.
