Parmesan-baked parsnips
Introduction:
These more-ish parsnips can be eaten as a warm snack, perhaps dipped into crème fraîche flavoured with dill or sweet chilli sauce. They make a good side with any meat or stew. 
Ingredients:
50g polenta 50g Parmesan, grated 1kg parsnips, peeled, cut into batons, woody core removed Oil for roasting Salt & pepper
Method:
Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Preheat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Combine the polenta, Parmesan and some seasoning in a large bowl. Add 4 tbsp oil to a roasting tin and pop it in the oven to warm. Add the parsnips to the boiling water pan and cook on a low boil for 3 minutes. Drain, leave for 2 mins to let excess water evaporate. Toss the parsnips in the Parmesan mixture and transfer to the roasting tray (take care as the oil may splutter a little). Roast for 35 minutes, until crisp and golden.
