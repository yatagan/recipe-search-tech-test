Orange and radish salad
Introduction:
Crunchy radishes are set off against the juicy sweetness of the orange for a fragrant, thirst quenching salad. This is traditionally served in Morocco before a main meal. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch radish 1 tbsp sugar juice of Â½ lemon 1 tsp orange flower water salt to season 1 orange cinnamon fresh mint
Method:
Wash the radish then either slice thinly or grate. Drain off any excess liquid and place on a plate. Sprinkle the sugar, lemon, orange flower water and salt then toss together and chill. Remove the skin and pith of the orange then either section the orange, cutting out the segments or for a less fiddly option, slice thinly across the orange. Just before serving mix the orange with the chilled radish, dust with cinnamon and sprinkle with a little freshly chopped mint.
