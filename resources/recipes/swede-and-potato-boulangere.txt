Swede and potato boulangère
Introduction:
This tasty gratin is very good with roast meats. You don't have to stick with potatoes and swede: Jerusalem artichokes, parsnips, celeriac and carrots can all be substituted in. A mandolin vegetable slicer is really useful here to get the slices as thin as possible, but otherwise a sharp knife will do fine. 
Ingredients:
½ large swede, peeled, quartered & very thinly sliced 4 medium to large potatoes, peeled & finely sliced 1 onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 125ml hot veg stock 125ml milk a little butter for greasing & dotting salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. In a large bowl, mix the swede, potatoes, onion and garlic together. Season well with salt and pepper. Grease a gratin or baking dish. Spread the veg evenly in the dish. Pour over the stock and milk. Dot with butter. Bake for about 45-60 minutes, depending on your oven, until the veg is cooked and has a brown and crispy top.
