Roast chestnuts
Introduction:
These taste even better roasted over an open fire – you just need something to rest the chestnuts on. Eat on their own as a snack; alongside a roast; inside a casserole or stew; or mixed in with your Christmas Brussels sprouts. 
Ingredients:
chestnuts
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut a cross into the skin of each chestnut with a small, sharp knife. Place the chestnuts in a roasting tin and bake in the oven until the skins open and the insides are tender - this can take anywhere between 10 minutes and half an hour. Remember to peel away the tough outer skin and the pithy white inner skin to get to the sweet kernel.
