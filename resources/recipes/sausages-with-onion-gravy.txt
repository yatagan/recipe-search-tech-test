Sausages with onion gravy
Introduction:
This comforting dinner recipe includes sufficiently generous amounts of gravy to satisfy even the most diehard gravy fanatic. The key to richness is to let the onions caramelise very slowly. Add mustard, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce to suit your taste. The traditional accompaniment is a mass of buttery mash â€“ though pureed parsnips would also be good. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 8 pork sausages 4 large onions (use half red onions, if possible), thinly sliced 2 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp plain flour 400ml chicken or beef stock 100ml red wine (or beer) about 1 tbsp each of mustard, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based pan, add the sausages and cook until browned all over. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onions to the pan, then cover and cook over a low heat for about 45 minutes, until they are completely soft, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Stir in the sugar and turn up the heat to caramelise the onions slightly. Add the flour and mix well, then turn down the heat and gradually stir in the stock and wine. Bring to a slow simmer and return the sausages to the pan. Cook for about 20 minutes, to reduce and concentrate the flavour. Stir in the mustard, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce to taste and season well. Serve with lots of mashed potato.
