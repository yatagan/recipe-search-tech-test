Roast pork fillet/tenderloin
Introduction:
This makes an excellent simple dinner for two or three and is far less fuss than pan-frying. It's good with green beans and spuds in most forms. Or you could roast a tray of root veg at the same time and have these and the pork with a green salad. 
Ingredients:
1 pork fillet mustard powder 2 sage leaves 2 streaky bacon rashers
Method:
Preheat oven to 220Â°C/Gas 8. Turn over the tail of the pork fillet to make a reasonably even cylinder and season with salt and pepper and a sprinkle of mustard powder. Place a couple of sage leaves then a couple of slices of streaky bacon along the top. Wrap in tin foil and roast in a hot oven for 30 minutes. Allow to rest and carve into medallions.
