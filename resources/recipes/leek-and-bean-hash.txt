Leek and bean hash
Introduction:
A supremely comforting dish of creamy beans, sweet leeks and sharp Cheddar. These patties go very well with a fried egg or a couple of sausages. Serve with a rough salsa made with chopped tomatoes, chilli, onion and vinegar with herbs through it. Leave out the cheese if you'd like to keep them vegan. 
Ingredients:
4 leeks, washed & shredded 1 garlic clove, crushed 4 tbsp olive oil 150g red kidney beans, soaked overnight & cooked 450g potatoes, baked ½ tsp ground coriander 50g Cheddar (or blue cheese) pinch nutmeg 1 egg, beaten 1 tbsp cornflour salt & pepper
Method:
Sauté leeks and garlic in 2 tablespoons of olive oil until soft. Add the kidney beans and cook for 3 minutes. Mix in the flesh of the potato, coriander, cheese, and nutmeg, then season. Mix in the egg and cornflour then chill for 30 minutes. Form the mixture into 8 patties, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry the patties over a high heat for 6 minutes on each side until golden.
