Pork and herb stuffed peppers
Introduction:
A bastion of 1970s dinner parties, the stuffed pepper shouldn't be discarded. Making the most of a little minced pork, and delicately seasoned with mace and garlic, this is a good light dinner or packed lunch. Use Ramiro peppers (the long, tapering kind) if you can – they're a little more flavourful than bell peppers. If you don't have any pork mince, squeeze out the insides of some Italian-style sausages instead.The breadcrumb meat ratio might seem a bit stingy, but it makes the filling lighter and less solid. 
Ingredients:
4 red peppers, halved with stalk, seed & pith removed 175g breadcrumbs 200ml milk 400g pork mince or sausage meat 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped ¼ tsp mace 1 tbsp Parmesan, grated a little olive oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6, oil a baking tray and roast the peppers, cut side up, for 10 minutes then allow to cool. Mix 150g of the breadcrumbs with the milk, squeeze out the surplus liquid, then add the mince, garlic, vinegar, parsley and mace. Stuff the peppers. Mix the remaining breadcrumbs with the Parmesan and sprinkle over the top. Brush with olive oil and cook for another 20 minutes.
