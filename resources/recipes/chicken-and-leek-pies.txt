Chicken and leek pies
Introduction:
Packed with creamy leeks and flavoured with tarragon and white wine, this is a delectable and heartening dinner. You can vary the veg and meat, substituting some of the leeks for mushrooms, adding in a handful of frozen peas or sweetcorn, or switching the chicken for turkey if you have some left over. This recipe makes 4 individual pies, but you could make one larger one - just cook the pie for a little longer. 
Ingredients:
60g plain flour ½ tsp cayenne pepper ½ tsp white pepper 1 tsp salt 500g chicken breast fillets, cut into 2cm dice 2 tbsp olive oil 25g butter 2 leeks, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 80ml water or white wine 250ml chicken stock 125ml cream 1 tsp tarragon small handful each fresh parsley & chives, chopped 300g puff or shortcrust pastry 2 egg yolks, beaten
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Place flour, peppers and salt in a bowl and stir. Add chicken and toss well. Shake off excess flour. Heat oil and butter in a pan over a high heat and stir fry chicken pieces until lightly browned and sealed. Remove chicken from pan and set aside. Place leeks and garlic in the pan and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes until soft or wilted. Add wine and boil for 1 minute. Add stock and cream and simmer gently for 5 minutes. Add chicken and herbs, cook for a minute longer then remove from heat and cool. Roll out pastry to 4mm thick. Cut pastry to line bases, sides and tops of 4, 9½ cm pie tins. Spoon filling in pastry cases and brush edges with egg yolks. Place tops on pies and seal with a fork. Brush tops with egg yolks and make three piercings with a sharp knife in the top of each pie. Bake on the bottom oven shelf for 35 minutes or until golden brown.
