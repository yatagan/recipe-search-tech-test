Kale caesar salad
Introduction:
A recipe by James Dodd, head chef at The Field Kitchen. This dish is always a hit with diners. Leaving the salad to sit for 15 minutes before serving allows the acidity to take away the raw taste and texture from the kale. 
Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, peeled 10 anchovy fillets or capers 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp red wine vinegar Juice of 1-2 lemons 2 poached eggs (blended hot) 250ml olive oil kale, preferably curly
Method:
Add all of the ingredients (except for the oil & kale) into a blender. Make sure the eggs are just poached and still hot. Blend. Slowly add the oil, bit by bit until smooth and completely blended. Toss with the kale and leave to sit for about 15 minutes before serving. Top with croutons and a hard cheese, like Parmesan, or whatever takes your fancy. Keep any leftover dressing in a fridge and use within a few days.
