Simple roasted onions
Introduction:
These thyme-infused whole roasted onions are spectacularly simple to make and bursting with luscious flavour. They're good with a roast or sausages. Or try breaking them apart and spreading on toast with grilled goat’s cheese or Brie. They re-heat well. 
Ingredients:
8 red or white onions, roots left intact knob of butter 1 tbsp light brown sugar 2 tbsp balsamic, sherry or red wine vinegar 100ml veg stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Put the onions into a fairly close-fitting baking dish. Melt the butter in a pan. Add the rest of the ingredients, then pour over the onions. Cover with foil and roast for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for another 45 minutes or so, until the onions are coloured and sticky.
