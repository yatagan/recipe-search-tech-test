Stir-fried celery with ginger and coriander
Introduction:
Full of flavour, this light but emphatic vegetarian side works well with fish and noodles, and especially fish cakes. It's very quick to prepare and requires few ingredients, making it a good way of jazzing up an otherwise uneventful midweek meal. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable or sunflower oil 2.5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 6 stalks celery, thinly sliced 1 tsp coriander seeds, coarsely crushed juice of Â½ large orange 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large wok over a high heat. Add the ginger and stir for a few seconds. Add the celery and stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add the crushed coriander seeds and continue to stir-fry for about another 3 minutes until the celery is browned. Reduce heat, add the orange juice, salt and pepper. Toss, then cover and simmer for 4 minutes or so until the liquid is absorbed. Stir in the chopped coriander and serve.
