Jerusalem artichokes, chorizo migas
Introduction:
Rich and tasty, migas is a Spanish dish that revives leftover stale bread by frying it in chunks with garlic, saffron and bay and whatever other ingredients you have by. It's good for brunch, lunch and dinner, especially if eaten with fried eggs. The Spanish often throw in a handful of halved grapes to cut through the richness of the chorizo. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil 2 large whole garlic cloves 100g stale sourdough or ciabatta bread, or similar, torn into chunks 2 bay leaves pinch saffron threads 2 Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean 100g cooking chorizo, skin removed, meat roughly chopped 2 roasted red peppers, skin & seeds removed, flesh roughly chopped squeeze of lemon juice small handful fresh parsley, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Put the oil, garlic, bread and bay leaves in a frying pan. Heat gently, stirring now and then, for about 25 minutes, until the bread is crispy all over. While the bread is frying, put the saffron threads in a heatproof bowl with 1 tablespoon of boiling water. Leave to stand. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the whole Jerusalem artichokes and cook until just tender, about 8-10 minutes, depending on size. Drain, leave to cool slightly, then cut into wedges. When the bread is cooked, add the saffron and water and fry to cook off the liquid and crisp up the bread again. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and add the chorizo and artichokes. Fry to cook the chorizo through and colour the artichokes. Put the bread back in the pan, season and stir in the roasted peppers to warm through. Squeeze over a little lemon to serve and sprinkle with parsley, if using.
