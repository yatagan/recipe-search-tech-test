Couscous and summer veg
Introduction:
This is a wonderfully diverse vegetarian salad of rich roast veg, crunchy raw veg, fresh herbs and sharp dressing. Despite the longish list of ingredients it's easily put together and makes a delicious light lunch. If you'd like a meaty accompaniment, lamb chops are good, especially if they're cooked on the barbeque .
