Spiced red cabbage
Introduction:
Good with Christmas dinner, even better with cold cuts on Boxing Day. It can be made in advance and reheats brilliantly. 
Ingredients:
1 red cabbage, very finely shredded, tough ribs & core removed 2 red onions, finely sliced 2 apples, cored & sliced or diced 1 tsp allspice ½ tsp caraway seeds 2 bay leaves 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, plus an optional splash more to finish 50g light brown sugar 4 tbsp redcurrant jelly or cranberry sauce salt & pepper
Method:
Put all the ingredients in a large, heavy-based pan, one with a lid. Season and bring up to a simmer on the hob. Cover and cook for 1 hour, checking and stirring regularly. If it does look like it’s catching any stage, add a splash of water (and check the hob temperature). Check the seasoning and add a splash more vinegar to taste, if needed.
