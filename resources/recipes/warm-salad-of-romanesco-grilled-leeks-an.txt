Warm salad of Romanesco, grilled leeks and haricots
Introduction:
Romanesco is an old variety of the broccoli family that's recently been rediscovered. It has a delicate, nutty taste and alien appearance that children often love. This quick and simple autumn recipe combines it's crunchiness with the sweetness of grilled leeks. 
Ingredients:
4 leeks, trimmed & cut lengthways in half 1 Romanesco, divided into florets 3 tbsp haricot beans (or cannellini), cooked 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 2 tsp balsamic vinegar 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the leeks in a large pan of boiling salted water for a few minutes until just tender, then drain and dry well. Heat a ridged grill pan, place the leeks on it and grill on both sides until ridge marks appear. Remove from the grill, cut into strips and set aside. Cook the Romanesco florets in boiling salted water until just tender. Drain well and toss with the grilled leeks, white beans, parsley, vinegar and olive oil. Season and sprinkle with the Parmesan, then serve.
