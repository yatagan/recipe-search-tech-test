Green beans with salsa verde
Introduction:
This salsa verde recipe is just a guide: you can add basil, change the herb quantities, use lemon juice instead of vinegar â€“ just keep tasting to make sure you're going in the right direction. It's also delicious with fish and roast lamb. A food processor is a big help, but if you don't have one just chop the ingredients by hand. 
Ingredients:
French or runner beans, cooked for the salsa verde: 1 garlic clove, crushed or chopped 1 tbsp capers, rinsed of vinegar or salt 2 -3 anchovy fillets (not essential but nice) 2 handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1 handful fresh mint leaves, plus another of basil if you like 1 tbsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the beans in boiling water for about 5 minutes until they are just tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Drain again. For the salsa verde, put all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse. You are aiming for a rough sauce not a smooth paste so don't go too far. When you've mixed everything up, taste and add more vinegar or lemon and seasoning according to taste. Dress the runner beans.
