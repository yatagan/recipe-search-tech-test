Joyce Molyneux's onion and soured cream salad
Introduction:
This could be a simple dip with anything from crisps to raw vegetables; or eaten with a spicy main course; or used as a dressing for anything from baked potatoes to chicken or boiled new potatoes. Try adding a few snipped chives at the end. Or, for a different, sweeter effect, fry the thinly sliced onions in a pan at a low heat until they start caramelising (about half and hour), then let cool and mix with the sour cream. 
Ingredients:
3 onions, red or white 80ml sour cream handful parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the onions.Cover with boiling water, leave for 1 minute, then drain thoroughly and cool. Dress with soured cream, salt, pepper and parsley.
