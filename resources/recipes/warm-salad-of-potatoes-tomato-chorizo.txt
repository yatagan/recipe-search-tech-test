Warm salad of potatoes, tomato and chorizo
Introduction:
A fresh, summery salad of pan-fried chorizo, tender roast new potatoes, intense, oven-baked tomatoes and crisp rocket. Paprika has a particular affinity with potatoes, tomatoes and chorizo, so you could add a pinch of this to each of them before cooking. 
Ingredients:
200-250g cherry tomatoes, halved 500g new potatoes, cut into even-sized pieces 6-8 small chorizo sausages for cooking (about 400g-500g), in fat slices 2-3 handfuls rocket or other salad leaves 1 tbsp olive oil mixed with 1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus 2-3 tsp more olive oil 2 tsp sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar a little chopped parsley to garnish
Method:
To roast the cherry tomatoes, place them cut side up on a baking sheet lined with non-stick parchment. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and season. Roast at 150°CGas 2 for 1½-2hrs until wrinkled and sticky but still moist. You need to do this in advance unless you have two ovens. Cook the potatoes in salted water until just tender – about 6-10 minutes depending on size. Drain and allow to steam dry. Heat the olive and sunflower oils in a deep roasting tray in a hot oven (220°C/Gas 7) for 5 minutes, then add the potatoes. Roast for 20-30 mins (depending on size) until golden. While the potatoes are cooking, fry the chorizo in 1 teaspoon olive oil, turning the pieces to ensure even cooking, until nicely coloured. Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter. Mix the cooked potato and chorizo with a few drops of vinegar and a little salt if needed, and heap on top of the salad leaves. Scatter the tomatoes over the top and add another sprinkle of vinegar and a drizzle of fresh olive oil. Finish with the parsley and serve warm.
