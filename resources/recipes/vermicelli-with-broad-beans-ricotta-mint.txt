Vermicelli with broad beans, ricotta and mint
Introduction:
This light vegetarian pasta dish is good to make early in the broad bean, while they're still small and tender and really to be savoured. Double-podding the beans is worth it in this recipe; put on a good tune, find a companion or pod in contemplative silence. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, finely sliced zest & juice of 1 lemon 150g broad beans, podded weight 200g vermicelli pasta 125g ricotta cheese, crumbled few mint leaves, shredded olive oil, for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the olive oil in a small pan and gently fry the garlic until just golden. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl with the lemon zest and juice. In a pan of boiling water, cook the broad beans for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh immediately in cold water, then remove and discard the outer skins to leave the inner green bean. Place in the same bowl as the garlic and lemon. Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water, according to the packet instructions. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking liquid. Add the drained pasta and ricotta to the bowl with the garlic and beans. Season well and gently toss to combine all the ingredients. Add a little of the reserved cooking liquid if needed. Serve sprinkled with the mint leaves and drizzled with a little olive oil.
