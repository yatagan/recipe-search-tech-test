Leek and potato soup with chicken, bacon and sage
Introduction:
This sumptuous soup combines all the wonderful flavours of roast dinner in one easy bowl. It's a truly lovely winter warmer and tastes even better re-heated, once the flavours have had time to commingle. 
Ingredients:
50g butter 1 onion, chopped 75g smoked streaky bacon, chopped 1 tbsp sage, chopped, or 1 tsp dried sage 450g leeks, finely sliced 450g potatoes, peeled & sliced about 1 litre chicken stock 200-300g cooked chicken, shredded a little cream (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a large pan, add the onion, bacon and sage, then cover and sweat for about 10 minutes. Add the leeks and potatoes and stir well. Add enough chicken stock to cover the vegetables, bring to the boil and simmer for about 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Take a few cups of the soup and pur√©e them in a food processor then stir back into the rest of the soup and mix well. This should bring the soup together. Stir in the cooked chicken, reheat thoroughly and season to taste. Add a dash of cream, if you like, and serve.
