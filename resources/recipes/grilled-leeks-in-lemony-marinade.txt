Grilled leeks in lemony marinade
Introduction:
This easy, healthy side goes well with grilled fish or meat. For a vegetarian accompaniment try it with warm puy lentils and a poached egg. You can substitute some of the leeks with fennel if you like. 
Ingredients:
4 whole trimmed leeks (cut in half lengthways if large) olive oil juice of 2 lemons 1 tbsp sugar 100ml water handful fresh coriander or parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch the leeks in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain and refresh in cold water. Drain well, brush lightly with oil and sear on a hot griddle pan. In a wide pan, gently heat the lemon juice, sugar and water. As the leeks come off the grill, place in the warm marinade. Leave for 5 minutes, then season, sprinkle with chopped coriander or parsley and serve.
