Turkey giblet stock
Introduction:
Use this savoury stock to add flavour to gravy or soup, or to moisten stuffing. If you have a carnivorous pet, the leftover meat will make them a special Christmas dinner as well.

turkey giblets (heart, liver, gizzard, neck) 1 onion, halved or quartered 1 celery stalk, roughly chopped or halved 1-2 carrots, cleaned or peeled & roughly chopped or halved few black peppercorns few parsley stalks 1 bay leaf 1 litre water
Method:
Place all ingredients in a saucepan and heat until boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 1- 1 Â½ hours. Occasionally skim as it rises to the top. Strain. Discard the veg and giblets. Leave to cool. This will keep in the fridge for a few days or can be frozen.
