Frying-pan spinach soufflé
Introduction:
The word soufflé seems to strike fear into the hearts of even competent cooks, but this version is simple and accommodating. All you’re looking for is to get the eggs to rise slightly, then crisp a little on top, like a puffy omelette. You need a smallish frying pan which can go in the oven – 21–23cm in diameter. The two things to get right with any form of soufflé are to whisk your egg whites until you can tip the bowl over your head without them falling out (really!) and to fold them in gently to keep as much air in the mixture as possible. 
Ingredients:
300g spinach, washed, leaves stripped from their stalks 4 eggs ¼ tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp wholegrain mustard 75g grated Cheddar sunflower or light olive oil, for frying salt & pepper
Method:
Heat your oven to 210˚C/Gas 6. Cook the spinach in a pan of boiling water for 1–2 minutes, until wilted. Drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. Wring it out with your hands to remove excess water, then roughly chop the leaves. Separate the egg whites and yolks into 2 bowls. Whisk the egg whites until they form firm but soft peaks – an electric whisk makes life easier. Lightly beat the egg yolks together. Add the spinach to the yolks, then add the nutmeg, mustard and three quarters of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Take a spoonful of the egg white and stir it into the egg yolk mixture, then very gently fold in the rest. Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a 21–23cm frying pan. Wipe the base and sides with kitchen paper to coat it. Heat the oil gently, then tip in the egg mix and tip the pan from side to side to cover it. Sprinkle over the remaining cheese. Transfer the pan to the oven for 10 minutes, until the mixture has risen and is fluffy and slightly golden from the melted cheese on top. Cut in half or wedges to serve.
