Chard, sweet potato and quinoa stew
Introduction:
A hearty, nutritious easy to make stew. This has lots of protein from the quinoa and sweet potato and makes an invigorating weeknight dinner. Use veg stock if you're vegetarian or vegan. The chard can be substituted or supplemented with any other green you get in your veg box â€“ spinach, kale, winter or summer greens. This is also good with finely minced ginger and a squeeze of lemon juice for more of a kick. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 200g chard, washed well, leaves stripped from their stalks, stalks finely chopped 1 onion, finely diced 1 carrot, finely diced 1 celery stick, finely diced 1 large sweet potato, about 500g, peeled & cut into 3cm dice 50g quinoa, rinsed & drained 500ml chicken stock 1 bay leaf 1 rosemary sprig salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan, add the chard stalks, onion, carrot and celery. Fry on a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring now and then to stop them catching. Add the sweet potato and quinoa. Pour in the chicken stock and bring up to a low boil. Add the bay leaf and rosemary. Season and simmer for 13 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the chard leaves for 3 minutes, then drain. Refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again and squeeze out any excess moisture. Roughly chop the leaves. After the chicken broth has cooked for 13 minutes, stir in the chard leaves to warm through. Check the seasoning before serving (remove the rosemary and bay leaf before eating).
