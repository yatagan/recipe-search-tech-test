Spiced squash, apple and cider soup
Introduction:
This unusual, velvety vegetarian soup brings together sweet apples and cider with punchy Indian spices and warming squash. Leave chunky or blend smooth depending on your preference. Top with a dollop of yoghurt or crème fraîche, minced chilli, black onions seeds and – if you aren't a vegetarian – salty, crispy lardons of bacon.
