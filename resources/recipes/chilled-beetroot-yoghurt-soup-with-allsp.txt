Chilled beetroot and yoghurt soup with allspice
Introduction:
A balance of sweet, earthy beets and tangy yoghurt, this makes a good summer starter. It can be eaten warm if you're timid with cold soup, but the subtle combination of raw and cooked beets lets you really enjoy the whole spectrum of their taste. 
Ingredients:
5-6 small beetroot, peeled 1 onion, chopped 2 tbsp olive or sunflower oil 1 garlic clove, chopped 250ml vegetable or light chicken stock 1 tsp sugar 6 tbsp plain yoghurt & more for serving 2-3 tsp cider or wine vinegar 1-2 tsp ground allspice handful mint leaves, roughly chopped, to serve 3-4 spring onions, sliced, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Finely grate 2 of the beetroot (if grating by hand, it is easier to part-grate 4 beets instead). Reserve them and cut remaining beets into even sized pieces. In a large heavy pan, sweat the onion in the oil until soft but not coloured. Add the beetroot pieces and garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the stock, partly cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes or so until the beetroot is soft. Pour the mixture into a blender with the raw grated beetroot, sugar and some salt and whiz until puréed. Return to pan or mixing bowl (you aren’t reheating the soup unless serving hot.) Add the 6 tablespoons yoghurt, vinegar, 1 teaspoon ground allspice and some black pepper. Mix well and taste for seasoning: you may want to add more sugar, vinegar, allspice, salt or pepper. Chill until ready to serve. Divide soup between 4 bowls. Float a spoonful of yoghurt in each bowl, and sprinkle with chopped mint and spring onion before serving.
