Lamb with twenty garlic cloves
Introduction:
Slowly cooked lamb shoulder is one of life’s great treats and Tom Kerridge’s version with boulangère potatoes is an extremely good option. It’s virtually viral so the recipe is easy to find. Alternatively, try braising it with loads of garlic and balsamic vinegar. 
Ingredients:
500g or 1kg boneless lamb shoulder 3 tbsp olive oil bouquet garni of thyme, rosemary & bay 8 small onions, whole & peeled 4 large carrots, peeled & chopped into large chunks 20 whole garlic cloves 150ml balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Rub the shoulder of lamb with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place a little more olive oil into the bottom of a large casserole pot with the onions, carrots, garlic and bouquet garni and sit the lamb on top. Place into the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the lamb, carrots and onions have coloured. Turn the oven down to 110°C/Gas Mark ¼. Cover with a suitable lid and cook for about 2½ hours. After 2 hours, remove the garlic, carrots and onions from the pot and reserve. Add the balsamic vinegar, and continue to cook for a further 30 minutes, with the lid off. Baste the shoulder in the vinegar liquid every 10 minutes. Transfer the lamb pan from the oven to the hob, remove the lamb to one side and reduce the meat juices over a low heat. Return the lamb and veg to the pan, warm through and serve with mashed potato.
