Classic fried chicken
Introduction:
Serve with a spicy coleslaw and homemade cornbread or potato wedges. 
Ingredients:
2 chicken legs, separated into thighs & drumsticks 150ml buttermilk, or a mixture of milk & yoghurt 1 tsp salt 100g plain flour good pinch each salt, paprika, cumin, turmeric & cayenne 6-8 tbsp sunflower or groundnut oil
Method:
Put the chicken in a bowl, mix the buttermilk (or yoghurt and milk) and salt together and pour over the chicken. Turn to ensure an even coating and refrigerate overnight. The next day mix the flour and spices and tip into a plastic bag. Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, giving it a bit of a shake to remove surplus liquid, and add to the flour bag. Seal the top and give it a shake to coat the chicken in the seasoned flour. Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Heat the oil in a smallish non-stick pan and put the chicken pieces into the pan. Carefully turn, using tongs, until evenly golden and beginning to crisp. Transfer to a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes. If you feel inclined, deep fry by all means but I’ve had good results with the fry/bake method as long as the chicken doesn’t catch in the pan and lose its coating.
