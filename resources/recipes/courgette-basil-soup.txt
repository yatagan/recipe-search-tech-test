Courgette and basil soup
Introduction:
This fresh summer soup is a lovely way of polishing off extra courgettes. It's a good light lunch with bread and salad, and is especially excellent if you serve it with a generous dollop of tomato chutney in the middle of the bowl. Use Pecorino or any other substitute hard cheese in place of Parmesan if you are a vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 6 or 7 courgettes, diced a handful of basil leaves 600ml hot chicken or vegetable stock 50ml cream, double or single parsley, chopped (optional) 50g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then fry the garlic, courgettes and basil with a pinch of salt for about 10 minutes, until softened. Add the stock, then simmer for another 10 minutes. Blitz the mixture in blender or food processor, reserving some of the courgette if you want a bit of texture in the soup, then return to the pan, stirring in any chunks of courgette you have reserved. Gently reheat, stirring in the cream, parsley and most of the Parmesan. Season. You may want to thin the soup with some milk or stock. Serve with the reserved Parmesan sprinkled on top.
