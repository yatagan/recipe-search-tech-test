Roasted brussels with sage and chestnut butter
Introduction:
Roasting is an easy way to bring out the best in sprouts. Topped with melting chestnut and sage-infused butter, this makes a lovely vegetarian side. It'll make more butter than you need – keep the rest in the fridge for a week and use it to toss with greens, top jacket potatoes, stuff poultry... 
Ingredients:
500g Brussels sprouts, trimmed olive oil 125g salted butter, softened at room temperature 100g cooked & peeled chestnuts (a vac-pack is the easiest way of buying chestnuts for cooking with), finely chopped 8 leaves sage, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Cut the sprouts in half through the core. Put in a baking dish and toss in just enough olive oil to lightly coat. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes or so, until just tender but still with some bite. Toss once or twice during cooking. Put the butter in a large bowl and beat well with a wooden spoon until very soft. Stir in the chestnuts and sage. Lay a piece of cling film on your work surface. Spoon the butter into the middle. Fold the cling film over and twist both ends to form a sausage shape. Refrigerate until needed. When the Brussels are roasted, slice 6 thin slices from the butter and toss in the sprouts just before serving. Check the seasoning before serving.
