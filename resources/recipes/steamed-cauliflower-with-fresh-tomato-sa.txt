Steamed cauliflower with fresh tomato sauce
Introduction:
This is a clean and simple way to enjoy a good, fresh cauliflower. Don't oversteam it – it should keep a bite and nuttiness. This also works with romanesco if you have this in your box. Try adding to the tomato sauce – olives, anchovies and capers are all excellent contrasts to cauliflower's mildness. 
Ingredients:
4-6 tomatoes 4 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, finely chopped ½ tsp sugar few drops lemon juice 1 cauliflower, leaves removed, cut into quarters or eighths if large salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the tomatoes by cutting a cross in the skin of each tomato at the non-stem end – try not to cut into the flesh. Drop the tomatoes into a pan of boiling water and remove after 1 minute or when the cut skin begins to peel back. Cool the tomatoes and the rest of the skin will come off easily. Quarter the tomatoes and remove the seeds. Dice finely. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan and sauté the garlic until just beginning to colour. Add the diced tomato, stir through and remove from heat. Season well. Add a little sugar or lemon juice. Steam the cauliflower pieces until just tender and put on a serving plate. Add the remaining olive oil to the tomatoes and then the chopped herbs. Pour over the cauliflower and serve.
