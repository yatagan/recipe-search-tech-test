Pork Indonesian style
Introduction:
Pork infused with the classic Indonesian flavours of lemon grass, ginger, lime and coconut. This aromatic dish goes very well with fluffy steamed or boiled white rice. 
Ingredients:
2 lemongrass stems 2 tbsp sunflower oil 3cm fresh ginger, finely shredded 1 green chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed & finely chopped 600g diced pork 1 tin coconut milk 6 spring onions, sliced 100g pak choi grated zest & juice of 1 lime salt & pepper
Method:
Bruise the lemongrass by bashing the bulb end of the stalk with the handle of a large kitchen knife. Heat a large wok and add oil, lemongrass, ginger, chilli and garlic, fry briefly to release flavours but try not to burn or the garlic will taste bitter. Now add the diced pork and brown all over, season lightly with salt and pepper. Shake the coconut vigorously before opening and pouring over the pork. Stir in, bring to the boil then lower to a bare simmer for 30-40 minutes until the pork has become tender. Now add the sliced spring onions and pak choi (if the leaves are small, leave them whole, if large then chop coarsely) and stir in. The vegetables will be cooked sufficiently with a further couple of minutes cooking time. Now sprinkle over the lime zest and add the juice, check seasoning and adjust if necessary. Serve with boiled rice.
