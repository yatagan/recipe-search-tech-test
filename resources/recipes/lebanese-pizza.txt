Lebanese pizza
Introduction:
Turkey and lamb mince are fairly similar in fat content and will both work well with spices in a Lebanese pizza. Normally I’m fairly ambivalent about pine nuts, but here, they’re definitely a must.
Ingredients:
2 onions, finely diced 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 4 white flatbreads (20cm diameter), either bought or homemade handful pine nuts, lightly toasted 350g turkey or lamb mince generous pinch each chilli, cumin & cinnamon 1 lemon 6 tbsp flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped a good pinch sweet paprika salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ºC/Gas 6. In a wide frying pan, preferably one with a thick bottom, fry the onion and garlic in the oil for a minute or two. With a small, sharp knife lightly score one side of the flatbreads so the topping will sink in; be careful not to cut right through. Tip the mince into the pan, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, add the ‘C’ spices and give it a good stir. Fry until there is no pink left. Some liquid will come out of the meat, so keep cooking over a high heat, giving it the odd stir, until this has all evaporated – this shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. If it does, tip the pan to one side and spoon out any liquid. Taste the mince for seasoning, then share between the flatbreads and spread out evenly. Scatter on the pinenuts, cover with clingfilm and push down with hands or a rolling pin. Transfer to a flat tray and bake for about 7 minutes. When they come out, give them a good squeeze of lemon, a sprinkling of parsley and a light dusting of paprika. I quite like a dollop of hummus on top as well.
