Smashed potatoes with onion & sage
Introduction:
A twist on traditional roasties. Squashing the spuds creates lots of edges and surface area that will crisp up in the roasting tray. We’ve added sage and onion, reminiscent of a classic Christmas stuffing.
Ingredients:
1kg small/medium potatoes salt and pepper olive oil 1 large red onion, sliced bunch of sage
Method:
Boil the potatoes, whole and with their skins on, in plenty of salted water, until just cooked. Drain well. This can be done well in advance; they can be roasted from cold. Preheat your oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Line a roasting tray with baking parchment, brush liberally with olive oil and scatter with salt. Add the sliced onion and spread it evenly across the tray. Evenly space the spuds in the tray on top of the onion. Press each one down so that it flattens but stays in one piece; you could use a saucer, potato masher or the flat of your hand (if cooking from cold). Brush them with plenty of oil and season with more salt. Roast for 40 mins, or until golden and crisp at the edges. The onions will have softened beneath them as they roast. Pick the sage leaves from their stalks and toss them with a dash of oil and a pinch of salt. Scatter them across the potatoes and return the tray to the oven for a final 5 mins. The sage should darken and crisp up in the oven. Serve immediately.
