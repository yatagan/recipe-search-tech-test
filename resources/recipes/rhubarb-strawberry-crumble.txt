Rhubarb and strawberry crumble
Introduction:
Sweet and tart, this dessert is a real favourite in the Field Kitchen when the rhubarb and strawberry seasons coincide. It's very easy to make and a great excuse for eating lots of cream or custard. Replace the flour with oats and fine oatmeal for a gluten free alternative. 
Ingredients:
2-4 rhubarb stalks, cut into slices 2cm thick 250g strawberries, hulls removed, large ones cut in half 165g plain flour 50g soft light brown sugar 150g rolled oats 125g unsalted butter
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Place the rhubarb in a deep pie dish. Toss the strawberries with a tablespoon of the flour and add to the rhubarb. Sprinkle half the sugar on top. Put the oats, butter and remaining sugar and flour in a food processor and pulse until the mixture starts to come together. Spread the crumble over the fruit and bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender and the crumble is browned. Serve with delicious clotted cream.
