Easy sauerkraut
Introduction:
True sauerkraut ('sour cabbage') is fermented for days. This short-cut version is tart yet sweet and works well for a quick dinner . Not one for the purists! Serve with pork or veggie sausages and mash. Any you don't eat will keep well for a few days in a jar. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil ½ medium green or white cabbage, about 250g 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp mustard seeds 2 tbsp cider vinegar 150ml ale or lager salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the cabbage and cook gently for a few minutes until the cabbage has wilted slightly. Add the sugar, mustard seeds, vinegar and ale. Season. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has reduced by about ⅔. Serve with cooked sausages.
