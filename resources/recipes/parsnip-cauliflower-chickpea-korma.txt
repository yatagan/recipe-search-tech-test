parsnip, cauliflower and chickpea korma
Introduction:
Curries are a really good way to use up vegetables. This mild, warming spicy curry transforms parsnips into a creamy, comforting cold-weather dinner in less than half an hour. The Indian flavours of ginger, coconut and fresh coriander work beautifully with parsnips. Eat with boiled rice or warm naan bread, and pickle or chutney. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp groundnut oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped 2.5cm piece of fresh ginger, peeled & finely grated 2 tsp medium–hot curry powder 2 tsp ground cumin 2 parsnips (about 300g), peeled and cut into 1cm chunks 400ml can coconut milk 400ml can chickpeas, drained 50g ground almonds 1 cauliflower (about 850g), cut into large florets juice of 1 lime 1 bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped salt & black pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in large heavy-bottomed pan then add the onion and fry, stirring occasionally over a medium–low heat for about 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a minute then add the curry powder, cumin and a good pinch of salt. Gently stir in the parsnips and cook for a further minute. Add the coconut milk, chickpeas and ground almonds, cover with a lid and cook at a gentle boil for 10 minutes. Check the seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed. Add the cauliflower, then cover again and cook for a further 5 minutes or so, until the cauliflower is just tender. Sprinkle the lime juice over the curry and stir in the coriander.
