Eat warm from the pan, slathered in butter and raspberry or strawberry jam. This simple recipe for drops scones (or Scotch pancakes) makes a brilliant afternoon treat or weekend breakfast, especially when kids want to help with the cooking. You can replace half the flour with wholemeal or spelt. 
Ingredients:
250g of plain flour, sifted 1 tbsp baking powder pinch of sea salt 1 tsp sugar 2 eggs, beaten 280-300ml milk 40g melted butter vegetable oil & butter, for frying butter & jam, to serve
Method:
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the sugar. In a separate bowl beat the eggs and add to the dry ingredients. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly. Add the melted butter. In a pan on medium heat wipe a little bit of oil and butter around the pan. Once heated add a tablespoon of the batter mixture at a time until you have four or five scones in the pan. Cook for 1 minute or so until you can see small bubbles appearing in the top of the mixture. Turn the scones over and cook for another minute of two. Keep warm until needed for serving with butter and jam.
