Parsnip couscous
Introduction:
This easy recipe is good for a light meal in the winter, or just as a side. Instead intensifying parsnip's natural sweetness, it balances it with zesty lemons and fresh herbs. For a more substantial meal, try this dish with lamb tagine or Moroccan-style stew. 
Ingredients:
500g couscous 115ml olive oil 250ml hot water 4 parsnips, peeled & cut into 1cm dice grated zest & juice of 3 lemons 1 tbsp each fresh coriander, mint & parsley, chopped, plus extra to garnish 1 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the couscous with a tablespoon of the olive oil and Â½ teaspoon of salt, working them through with your hands. Add the hot water, mix thoroughly, then cover and leave to one side. Put the diced parsnips in a pan, add just enough water to cover, plus a little salt, and bring to the boil. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the parsnips are tender. Uncover the couscous and add the parsnips and their cooking water, plus the remaining olive oil, the lemon zest and juice and the herbs. Mix well, season to taste and then leave, covered, in a warm place for about 30 minutes. Serve sprinkled with the pine nuts and more herbs.
