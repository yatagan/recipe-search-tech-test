Moroccan spiced lamb with beetroot
Introduction:
A succulent, warmly spiced trio of griddled lamb chops, punchy beetroot and yoghurt purée and fragrant couscous. Roasting the beetroots takes a while, but this recipe is easy to follow and makes a delectable dinner. 
Ingredients:
for the beetroot purée: 600g small beetroot, trimmed of leaves & root, left whole in their skins 120g plain yoghurt for the lamb: 2 tbsp olive oil zest & juice of 1 lemon 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 3 tsp ground coriander 3 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp smoked sweet paprika 3 tsp fennel seeds 4 lamb steaks for the couscous: 200g couscous 25g butter zest & juice of 1 lemon, more to taste large handful fresh herbs, chopped – parsley, coriander & mint salt & pepper
Method:
For the beetroot: Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Wrap the beetroot in foil and place in a baking dish. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes - test with a knife. Remove from the oven and leave until cool enough to handle, then rub off the skins. Roughly chop, then blitz in a food processor with the yoghurt, seasoning to taste. For the lamb: Mix the oil, lemon zest and juice, garlic and spices in a bowl. Add the lamb and toss together. If you have time, marinate in the fridge for an hour or two. Put the couscous in a large bowl and add just enough boiling water to cover. Pop in the butter, stir and leave to absorb for about 10 minutes. Fluff it up with a fork. Add the lemon zest, juice, herbs and stir. Heat a griddle pan until very hot. Cook the lamb on both sides for 3-4 minutes, depending on thickness. Rest the meat for 5 minutes, then serve with the couscous and a dollop of beetroot purée (warm it in a pan if you like).
