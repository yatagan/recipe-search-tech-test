Papaya & coconut smoothie
Introduction:
Both papaya and banana are very mellow tastes and partner well with most things. You could add pineapple, watermelon, mango or even a little carrot juice into the mix if you want to experiment. The sweetness of the papaya will differ with ripeness, so the honey is best added to taste; as are the strong sharpness and heat of the lime and ginger. 
Ingredients:
1 papaya 2 bananas 200ml coconut milk handful of ice cubes 2 limes honey, to taste 10g freshly grated ginger
Method:
Cut away the skin and seeds from the papaya. Roughly dice the flesh. Peel the bananas. Put the bananas, papaya and coconut milk in a blender. Whizz together, adding ice until you get the consistency you want. Add lime juice and honey to taste. The ginger is optional; add as much or as little as you like. Drink cold.
