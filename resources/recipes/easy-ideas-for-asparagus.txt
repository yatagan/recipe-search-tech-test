Easy ideas for asparagus
Introduction:
Often with asparagus less is more: the trick is not to overcook them or to drown out their delicate pungency with loud accompaniments. 
Ingredients:
asparagus
Method:
We like asparagus best sprinkled with salt and olive oil and maybe a few thyme leaves, then roasted in a hot oven (200°C/Gas 6) for about 5–7 minutes. This seems to intensify the flavour. You can also steam it, but if you don’t have a steamer, chuck the trimmed asparagus into a deep pan of boiling salted water for 2–3 minutes (more for really chunky spears), ideally with the stems in the water and the heads in the steam above. They really don’t need much more than salt, and maybe some butter and lemon, or hollandaise sauce. A real treat with a poached egg, (see page 20), or dipped in a soft-boiled egg. Toss asparagus spears in a little olive oil, then cook on a ridged griddle pan or barbecue until tender. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and season lightly. Serve cooked asparagus topped with a poached egg, a couple of slices of prosciutto and a few Parmesan cheese shavings, plus a drizzle of olive oil and some freshly ground black pepper. Individually wrap boiled asparagus spears in a slice of smoked salmon or good ham.
