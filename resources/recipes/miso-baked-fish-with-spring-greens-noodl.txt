Miso baked fish with spring greens and noodles
Introduction:
Quick enough for a weeknight, this Asian-style recipe for salmon or white fish has a lovely balance of sweet and salty flavour. Miso paste is fairly readily available in shops, or order some with your veg box. Instead of it you could use a tablespoon of soy sauce mixed with freshly grated ginger and chopped garlic. 
Ingredients:
350-400g salmon or sustainable white fish, use one with large flakes like pollack or sea bass, in two portions a little oil for greasing & frying, e.g. sunflower 1 tbsp miso paste juice of 1 lemon 1 tsp caster sugar 200g dried Asian style noodles, use soba or udon if you can get them, if not, any egg or rice noodle will be fine 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 red chilli, chopped (remove the seeds if you prefer less heat) 150-200g spring greens, washed & shredded (remove any tough stalks) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat oven to 190ËšC/Gas 5. Put the salmon skin side down in a lightly oiled baking dish. In a small bowl, mix the miso, half the lemon juice, caster sugar, and some freshly ground black pepper together and pour over the salmon. Bake in the oven for about 8 minutes, or a little more, until just cooked through, depending on the thickness of the fish pieces. While the fish is cooking, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain and toss in the sesame oil. Heat a little oil in a large pan (a frying pan is ideal), add the spring greens and chilli and fry until the greens have wilted, about 3-4 minutes. Toss with the noodles and the rest of the lemon juice. Serve the salmon on top of the noodles.
