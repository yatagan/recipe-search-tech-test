Ham hock, leek and bean pot
Introduction:
Our ham hock is made in our own farm kitchen. It tastes great and makes up part of this simple one-pot dish. With our ready-made chicken stock to add extra flavour, this warming supper will be on the table in no time. We’ve not listed adding any salt as there is salt in the ham hock, but taste and add a little if you like. Vary the greens, adding shredded sprouts, spring greens too as well as the leek, or try some blanched spinach or chard leaves. A little watercress added at the last minute is also good. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable 2 large leeks, trimmed, halved & finely shredded 1 large or more smaller carrots, peeled & finely diced 2 celery sticks, trimmed & finely diced leaves from 3-4 good thyme sprigs, or 1 good tsp dried thyme 500ml chicken stock 150g pulled ham hock 1 tin cannellini or other white beans, drained & rinsed 1 tbsp Dijon mustard – add to taste 30g fresh parsley, leaves chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy-based pan. Add the leek, carrot and celery. Fry on a low heat for 10 minutes to soften them, stirring now and then to stop them catching. If they look like catching at any point, add a splash of water and turn the heat a little lower. After 10 minutes, add the thyme. Stir for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock. Season with a little pepper. Bring up to a low boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the ham hock and beans. Stir and simmer for 5 minutes to warm them through before stirring in the mustard (to taste) and parsley. Check the seasoning before serving.
