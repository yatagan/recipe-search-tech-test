Marinated cucumber salad
Introduction:
Marinated in vinegar and sugar, these chunky cucumbers keep a refreshing crunch. This simple little salad makes a good, crisp side dish to anything from burgers to grilled fish. 
Ingredients:
1 cucumber, peeled 2 tbsp rice vinegar or cider vinegar 2 tsp caster sugar 1 tsp salt
Method:
Halve the cucumber lengthways and run a teaspoon along its middle to scoop out the seeds. Slice the cucumber halves into 3-4cm crescents and arrange on a plate. Make the dressing by combining the vinegar, sugar and salt, making sure the sugar and salt dissolve. Pour over the dressing and leave to marinate for 30 minutes-2 hrs. Drain off excess liquid before serving.
