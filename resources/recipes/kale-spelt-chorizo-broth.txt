Kale, spelt and chorizo broth
Introduction:
This recipe is quick and easy to make, and the kind of food to treat yourself to on a chilly midweek evening. You can make it hot and spicy by adding lots of chilli, or mild and creamy by stirring in a tablespoon of crème fraîche in the last couple of minutes of cooking. In place of kale you could use spinach, chard or winter greens, depending on what you have in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, eg. rapeseed 1 onion, chopped 2 cooking chorizo sausages, skins peeled off, meat broken into small pieces 1 dried red chilli (add to taste) 4 tomatoes, finely chopped 150g pearled spelt, rinsed well & drained 1½ litre light chicken stock 200g kale, leaves stripped from stalks & roughly chopped (curly kale or cavolo nero is best - if using red Russian kale, leave all but the very large stalks on) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a saucepan. Add the onion and fry very gently for 10 minutes without colouring, until soft and translucent. Add the chorizo and fry for a couple of minutes until golden. Add the chilli and tomatoes. Stir in the spelt, add the stock and season. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the kale and cook for approx 15 minutes, until the spelt is tender. Keep an eye on the liquid and top up a little if needed (check your heat too, it may be too high). Check the seasoning and serve.
