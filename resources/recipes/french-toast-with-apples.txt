Introduction:
French toast transfigured into a sumptuous dessert 
Ingredients:
for caramel sauce: 50g butter 60g sugar 3 tbsp whipping cream for the batter: 2 egg yolks 60g sugar 3 tbsp whipping cream for the apples: 4 apples 30g butter for the toast: 1 baguette 30g butter
Method:
First make the sauce: Melt the butter and sugar until golden brown, add the cream carefully and stir well, keep warm. For the batter: Mix together the batter ingredients and set aside. For the apples: Peel, half and core the apples. Cut into wedges, lightly colour in 30g of butter in a small frying pan. Do not cook through but transfer to the caramel sauce and finish cooking until tender. For the toast: Cut the baguette into 4 thick slices on the diagonal (can be a bit stale). Soak the bread slices in the batter mixture and then fry over a fairly high heat in 30g of butter until golden on both sides. Place the toast on a plate with the apples on top and drizzle over the caramel sauce. Great with custard, cream or both.
