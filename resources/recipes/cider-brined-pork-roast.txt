Cider brined pork roast with rhubarb, ginger and sage sauce
Introduction:
The sharp flavours of rhubarb work spectacularly well with pork. Make sure you leave the pork to brine for the full 24 hours or the middle of the joint won't be effected. You can use a larger pork joint, just adjust the cooking time. 
Ingredients:
for the pork: 250g light brown sugar 300g salt 8 bay leaves 3 tbsp coriander seeds 1 tsp black peppercorns ½ litre water 1 litre proper dry cider (Ashridge is perfect) 600g boneless pork joint olive oil for the sauce: 400g rhubarb, washed & trimmed 20g butter 2 shallots, finely chopped 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 10 sage leaves, chopped honey, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
First, prepare the pork: Make the brine by putting the sugar, salt, bay leaves, coriander seeds, peppercorns and water in a saucepan and bringing to the boil. Stir until the salt and sugar are dissolved and allow to cool. Add the cider and when completely cool place the pork in a leak free plastic bag, pour in the brine and seal. Place the bag in a bowl in the fridge so the meat is submerged in the brine. Leave for 24 hours. After use, tip the brine into a saucepan and bring to the simmer. Cool and store in the fridge to use again. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Remove the pork from the bag, pat dry with kitchen paper and leave for half an hour to come up to room temperature. Brush the pork with olive oil, and rub in some salt and pepper. Place in the oven and roast for 35 minutes per 500g, plus an extra 35 minutes before resting for 10-15 minutes. Always test pork by inserting a skewer into the thickest part of the joint; the juices must run clear, not pink. Make the sauce by trimming the rhubarb and stripping away any strings. Cut into 2cm lengths and stew gently in the butter in a stainless steel pan with the chopped shallots, grated ginger, torn sage and some salt and pepper until tender. Increase the heat to evaporate some of the liquid and add a little honey to taste.
