Whole roasted cauliflower with almonds and garlic
Introduction:
Roasted whole then drizzled with spiced almonds, this cauliflower recipes makes a good vegan alternative to a classic roast chicken. You could also serve it as a starter, setting it in the centre and letting people help themselves. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower olive oil, for roasting 50g flaked almonds 4 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp smoked sweet paprika 1 tbsp dry sherry 3 tbsp fresh parsley, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut off any green leaves from the cauliflower and trim the core so it sits flat in a baking dish. Drizzle over just enough oil to cover the top of the cauliflower. Sprinkle over a little sea salt. Roast until the top is golden brown and the cauliflower is just tender, about 1 hour. Keep it warm in the oven. Put the almonds in a frying pan and heat gently until toasted. Add the oil and garlic and fry for a minute or two. Add the paprika and dry sherry and cook to reduce the liquid slightly. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Present the cauliflower whole at the table, then cut into thin slices and drizzle over the almonds to serve.
