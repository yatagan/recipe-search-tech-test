Simple root veg beanpot
Introduction:
Delicately flavoured with thyme or rosemary, we originally designed this nourishing dish as a basic vegetable recipe for toddlers â€“ but it's turned into a popular meal for adults too! As there aren't many ingredients, be sure to use good stock for maximum flavour. Either eat on its own as a very easy one-pot dinner, or with brown rice, quinoa or warm bread. If you aren't vegan or vegetarian, you could also add a little chorizo to cook with the onions. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion, finely diced small handful fresh thyme leaves, or very finely chopped rosemary leaves 450g mixed root veg, e.g. potatoes, carrots, swede, parsnips, sweet potato, peeled & diced 500ml veg or chicken stock 400g tin cooked haricot or cannellini beans, rinsed & drained small handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy based pan. Add the onion and fry very gently for 10 minutes, stirring often. Add the thyme or rosemary and root veg. Stir for 2 minutes. Pour in the stock. Season, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the veg is just tender. Add the beans. Stir and simmer for 5 minutes to warm the beans. Lightly mash half the stew for a slightly different texture. Check the seasoning and sprinkle with parsley to serve.
