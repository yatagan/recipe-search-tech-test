Slow-cooked red onions
Introduction:
You can also use shallots or white onions for this as well, but red will give the sweetest results. Slow-cooking brings out the natural sugar in onions; use them in everything from risottos, pasta sauces and pizza toppings to soups, stocks, and stews. They also make a good accompaniment to fish and meat. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 4-5 red onions, depending on size, cut into quarters (leave the root intact so they don’t fall apart) 1 tsp sugar 3 tbsp red wine vinegar 2 tbsp tomato purée small handful raisins 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves small handful fresh parsley, chopped 8 tbsp water
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onions and fry until they have slightly coloured. Add sugar and vinegar and cook for a few minutes more. Add the tomato purée, raisins, herbs, water. Cook on a very low heat for about 40 minutes.
