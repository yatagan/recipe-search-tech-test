Shakshuka
Introduction:
A convenient one-pot recipe that makes an unbeatable hungover brunch, light lunch or supper. There are many different versions of this North African recipe: you could add feta, preserved lemons, olives or chorizo. Just make sure you don't overcook the eggs. Eat with bread or pitta to absorb the juices. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, thinly sliced 1 red pepper, sliced 1 yellow pepper, sliced 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, crushed 200g tin chopped tomatoes 1 tsp salt ¾ tsp ground black pepper ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground coriander 4 eggs fresh parsley, chopped, to garnish
Method:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan, add the onions and cook gently for 5 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Add the peppers and chilli, then cover and cook for 8 minutes or until the peppers are just tender. Stir in the garlic, chopped tomatoes, salt and spices, then cover again and cook for 8–10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Using the back of a tablespoon, make 4 indentations in amongst the vegetables and carefully break an egg into each one. Cover and cook over a low heat for about 5 minutes, basting occasionally with the juices, until the eggs have set. (If you prefer the eggs scrambled, you can mix them with a fork before covering the pan.) Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve. It’s good with salad and warm pitta bread.
