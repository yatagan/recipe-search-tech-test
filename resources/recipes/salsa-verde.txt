Salsa verde
Introduction:
This green sauce can be customised to taste, adjusting the quantities of anchovies, mustard etc, and even adding in a bit of chilli. The consistency depends on how you intend to use the salsa: it should be quite thick if you are serving it as a sauce for lamb or fish, thinner if it is being used for coating vegetables or as a dressing. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp capers, soaked in water for 20 mins, then drained & squeezed dry 2 anchovy fillets small bunch flat-leaf parsley 10 mint leaves 1 tsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp red wine vinegar olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Place the garlic, capers, anchovies, parsley and mint in a food processor and blend well (or chop finely by hand). Place the mixture in a bowl and add the mustard and vinegar. Drizzle in enough olive oil to give the correct consistency and season well.
