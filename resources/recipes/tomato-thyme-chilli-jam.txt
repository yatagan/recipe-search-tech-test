Tomato, thyme and chilli jam
Introduction:
This delectable sweet and spicy tomato and chilli jam has more-or-less endless uses. Eat it on toast with cream cheese for breakfast. Spread on corn on the cob, or dollop on baked eggs, lamb or red meat. Add it to your cheese board – especially with strong Cheddar and tangy, soft goat's cheese. Let it mature for at least a month before eating. Makes 3 8oz jars. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp sunflower oil 500g onions, chopped 1kg tomatoes, skinned & chopped 6 red chillies, deseeded & chopped 3 sprigs thyme, leaves only 2 tbsp tomato purée 1 tsp paprika 300ml white wine vinegar 250g granulated sugar salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a preserving pan and fry the onions very gently, stirring now and then, for 10 minutes to soften. Add the tomatoes, chillies and stir. Add the rest of the ingredients and season. Cook, uncovered, for 1 hour, until thickened. Ladle into hot sterilised jars. Press out any air with a knife. Seal with sterilised lids. Leave to cool, label and leave for 4 weeks before using.
