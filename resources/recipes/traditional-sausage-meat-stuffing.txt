Traditional sausage meat stuffing
Introduction:
Herby homemade stuffing. If you aren't feeling too traditionalist you could also add chopped walnuts, apricots, pine kernels or cranberries to the basic mix. This makes enough to serve with a small or medium turkey, about 5½-6½kg. If you want a crispy finish, roll your stuffing into balls and cook apart from the meat – stuffing the bird will keep the filling soft. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, very finely chopped 25g butter 1 garlic clove, crushed 100g fresh white breadcrumbs 1kg sausage meat 1 large apple, peeled, cored & finely chopped large handful fresh parsley, finely chopped small handful fresh sage, finely chopped 1 egg, beaten (optional, it makes for a less crumbly stuffing, so add to your own preference) salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the onion gently in a small knob of butter until just tender, approx. 10 mins. Put the onion, garlic and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Add 75ml water and use your hands to mix it together. Mix in the sausage meat, apple, parsley, sage and some salt and pepper to season. Mix in the beaten egg if you prefer a less crumbly stuffing. Use to stuff the turkey neck or if you want to cook it separately, spread into a lightly greased baking dish, cover with foil and cook at 190˚C/Gas 5 for 30 minutes, then uncover and cook for a further 10 minutes or so, until slightly crunchy on top.
