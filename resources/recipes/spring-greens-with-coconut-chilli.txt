Spring greens with coconut and chilli
Introduction:
In Samoa, one of the national dishes is palusami, which consists of a foil-wrapped parcel of young taro leaves, coconut cream and garlic placed in a stone oven and cooked slowly for several hours. We have emulated this using spring greens, which do look a bit like taro leaves. It is quite a rich dish and makes a lovely accompaniment to spicy grilled chicken or fish. It would also work using spinach. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch spring greens, thinly sliced 2 tsp sunflower oil 3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt 2 dried chillies, chopped 400ml coconut milk juice of Â½ lemon
Method:
Blanch the greens in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain, refresh in cold water and squeeze out the excess. Set aside. Heat the sunflower oil in a pan, add the garlic and chillies and fry over a low heat for a minute or so. Add the coconut milk and simmer over a high heat for 10 minutes, until reduced by about half. Stir in the spring greens and cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the coconut milk is just coating the greens. Finish with the lemon juice.
