Moorish skewers
Introduction:
Chicken satay is a good option, or you could go Moorish with Pinchos Morunos (Moorish skewers). Made with diced chicken leg, they will be more pinchitos than pinchos but with a little dexterity, easily done. 
Ingredients:
350g chicken Â½ tsp each dried thyme & oregano 1 tsp each coriander, paprika & cumin 3 tbsp olive oil
Method:
Marinade the chicken for 2 hours with the herbs, spices and olive oil. Thread chicken onto skewers and grill until the chicken is cooked through.
