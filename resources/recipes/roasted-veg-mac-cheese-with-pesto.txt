Roasted veg mac and cheese with pesto
Introduction:
Roasted veg baked with macaroni in a luxuriant creamy sauce, topped with tomatoes, Parmesan and pesto. While still utterly luxuriant, this is a lighter take on the classic mac and cheese. It's a good way of using up odds and ends from your veg box and needs only a green salad from a complete dinner. If you are a vegetarian, substitute the Parmesan with another hard cheese. 
Ingredients:
600g mixed vegetables for roasting (any or all of peppers, courgettes, broccoli, aubergines, onions) 2 tbsp olive oil 320g macaroni (or use penne) 500ml crème fraîche 150g Parmesan cheese (or other hard cheese), grated, plus extra for sprinkling 4 tomatoes, sliced 2 tbsp pesto salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas Mark 4. Cut the veg into cubes about 1-2cm (if using broccoli, cut into florets, if using onion, peel and cut into wedges, root intact). Put the vegetables in a baking dish and toss in the olive oil to coat. Season well and roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, until just tender. (If using broccoli, roast for 10 minutes only). Remove from the oven. While the veg is roasting, cook the pasta in a large pan of salted, boiling water, according to the packet instructions. Drain and reserve some of the cooking liquid. Toss the drained pasta in a large bowl with the crème fraîche, cheese and a couple of tablespoons of pasta water. Spread the pasta over the roasted veg. Lay the sliced tomatoes on top, sprinkle over the Parmesan and dot the pesto over the cheese. Bake in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until the top is crispy and turning golden.
