Chicken with herby harissa and grubby rice
Introduction:
It’s not quite dirty rice because there aren’t any chicken livers or giblets. but grubby will do.
Ingredients:
4 chicken quarters 150g herby harissa 3 tbsp olive or other cooking oil 1 large onion, chopped 3 celery sticks, chopped 1 green pepper, chopped 300g diced butternut squash, diced 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 350g basmati rice 750ml veg or chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 100°C/Gas¼. Cut the chicken legs in half and the breasts into three plus wings (discard the wing tip), place in bowl and add the harissa. Turn until well-coated. Spread out in a roasting tray, skin side up and cook in the oven for 1 hour. Switch the oven up to 180°C/Gas 4 and bake for another 40 minutes. Baste the chicken every 15 minutes or so. Meanwhile, in a medium heavy saucepan, heat up the oil and add the onions. Sauté, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Add the celery, green pepper and butternut squash and cook for another 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn up the heat a little and add the rice. Stir for a minute or so to make sure it has an even coating and add the stock. Bring to the boil, stir once and switch the heat to minimum setting. Place on a heat diffuser, lid and leave to cook for 15 minutes. Check that it’s done and season if necessary - most veg stocks are quite salty so you probably won’t need to. Fluff up the rice and serve topped with the chicken.
