Smoked salmon with celeriac remoulade
Introduction:
At once creamy and slightly acidic, celeriac remoulade is a good foil to the rich oiliness of smoked salmon. For a veggie option, serve the remoulade with some sliced sourdough, brushed with a little olive oil and griddled or toasted, and with a watercress salad. 
Ingredients:
½ medium celeriac, peeled juice of ½ lemon, more to taste 2-3 tsp Dijon mustard, to taste 75ml mayonnaise ½ tbsp double cream ½ tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 4 slices smoked salmon ½ lemon, cut into wedges
Method:
Cut the celeriac into matchsticks about 3mm thick, either by hand or using a mandolin. Add them to a large pan of boiling water and cook for 1 minute, then drain well and leave to cool. Mix the lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of mustard, mayonnaise, double cream and parsley together in a large bowl. Season well and mix in the celeriac. Check seasoning, add more mustard and lemon juice to taste. Serve a spoonful alongside some a smoked salmon slice and a lemon wedge, with a watercress garnish and some sourdough bread.
