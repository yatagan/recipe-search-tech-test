Lamb and potato curry
Introduction:
A hearty, Indian-spiced weeknight curry. Serve with rice or naan bread, yoghurt and chopped fresh coriander if you have it. Stir in a generous handful of spinach at the end of cooking for some added green. Try sweet potatoes instead of normal potatoes – their sweetness goes well with lamb. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp oil for frying 450g minced lamb 3 cardamom pods 2 onions, finely chopped ½ tsp ground cinnamon 2 tsp garam masala 2 tsp chilli powder 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2-3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & grated 250g potatoes, peeled & diced 1 tin chopped tomatoes salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Fry the lamb on a medium heat until browned all over, then lower the heat and cook it gently for 5 mins or so. Transfer to a plate. Add a splash more oil to the pan and gently fry the onion for 10 minutes. Add the cardamom pods and cinnamon. Fry for 1 minute. Add the lamb, garam masala, chilli, garlic, ginger. Fry for 2 minutes. Add the potatoes, tomatoes and cover. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the lamb is cooked to your liking. Check the seasoning and serve with rice or naan.
