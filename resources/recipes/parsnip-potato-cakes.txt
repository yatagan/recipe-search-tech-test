Parsnip and potato cakes
Introduction:
This is a quick and simple lunch with chutney and salad. Or you could eat it for breakfast with a poached egg or top. Or for dinner with grilled sausages and steamed broccoli. 
Ingredients:
350g potatoes, peeled & diced 700g parsnips, peeled & diced oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped 20g butter 4 tbsp milk pinch nutmeg, grated 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1-2 eggs, beaten 120g fresh breadcrumbs salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes, then the parsnips, until just tender (the potatoes will take about 10 minutes, parsnips about 7). Drain. While the potatoes are cooking, heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large pan, add the onion and fry for a few minutes until soft. Add the garlic and fry for another couple of minutes. Put the potatoes, parsnips, butter, milk and nutmeg in a large bowl and season, then mash together before stirring in the onion and parsley. Set aside until cool. Put the eggs and breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Take about 1 tablespoon of the potato/parsnip mix and use your hands to press it into a pattie shape. Dip it in the egg and then the breadcrumbs to coat and repeat until all the mixture is used. Add a little oil to a non-stick frying pan and fry the cakes, in batches, until golden on both sides. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven until you are ready to serve.
