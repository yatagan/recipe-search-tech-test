Slow-cooked oxtail with carrots and potatoes
Introduction:
You'll need a knife, fork and spoon to eat this; it gives you a light broth-style sauce with tender chunks of meat and veg. If you prefer it thicker, add a touch more flour after browning the oxtail. You can either cook it slowly on the hob, or put it in the oven on a low heat (150°C/Gas 2) for the same time. It reheats brilliantly – the flavours really come together. Served with some simply braised red Russian kale or Savoy cabbage. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 onions, finely sliced 500g oxtail pieces 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 1 tbsp plain flour 150ml red wine 500ml beef stock 2 sprigs fresh thyme 300g carrots (about 3 large), peeled & roughly chopped 500g potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large, heavy-based casserole dish, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Fry the onions gently for 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep to one side. Increase the heat, add the oxtail and fry on all sides until well browned. Put the onions back in the pan with the garlic and fry for a minute more. Add the flour, toss to coat the oxtail. Fry for a couple of minutes. Add the wine, bring to the boil and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the stock and thyme and season. Increase the heat until boiling. Reduce the heat to a bare simmer, and cook for at 3-4 hours until the meat is very tender. Add the carrots and potatoes after 2 hours of cooking. Check the seasoning before serving.
