Pale, silky leeks in a sharp dressing of mustard and vinegar. This makes an easy vegetarian supper, or a starter or side at a dinner party. It's also good with a handful of toasted breadcrumbs on top. It can be eaten warm or at room temperature and goes well with thin slices of ham and with cold chicken. 
Ingredients:
8 medium leeks, trimmed 1 tbsp white wine vinegar Â½ tsp Dijon mustard 4-5 tbsp olive oil 1 hard-boiled egg, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Boil or steam the leeks until just tender. While they are cooking make the vinaigrette: whisk the vinegar with the mustard, salt and pepper. Gradually whisk in the olive oil a tablespoon at a time. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Drain the leeks thoroughly, slice in half lengthways, then, while still hot, place in a shallow dish and spoon over the vinaigrette. Leave to cool, then scatter with the chopped egg and parsley.
