Mango & carrot juice
Introduction:
This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order to plunge. 
Ingredients:
3 medium carrots, peeled 1 mango, peeled & stoned
