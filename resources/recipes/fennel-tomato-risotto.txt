Fennel and tomato risotto
Introduction:
A bowl of steaming risotto is quick to cook and a good way of making one small fennel bulb into a meal. Be sure to fry the fennel gently for the full 8-10 minutes to get the best of its sweet, caramel flavour. Substitute the Parmesan for a vegetarian equivalent if you like. 
Ingredients:
50g butter, plus a little extra to finish 2 tbsp olive oil 1 bulb fennel, trimmed & finely sliced 300g risotto rice 1 tin of chopped tomatoes or 6 whole tomatoes, cut into eighths, seeds removed splash white wine (optional) 1.2 litres veg stock a few leaves fresh tarragon, chopped, or use the fronds from your fennel bulb Parmesan, grated, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
In a large heavy-based saucepan, heat the butter and oil. Add the fennel, reduce the heat and cook gently for about 8-10 minutes, until the fennel has softened and is turning a golden colour. Add the risotto rice and stir for 2-3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, the white wine if using, then gradually add a ladle of stock at a time, until all the liquid is absorbed and the risotto is tender but still has some bite (about 20-25 minutes). Season well and stir in the fennel fronds or tarragon. Add another knob of butter and stir into the risotto to melt. Serve sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese.
