Potato, leek and pancetta gratin
Introduction:
This is a rich, creamy one-pot dinner or an indulgent side to a roast. It's an easy-to-follow recipe that can be made vegetarian: just omit the pancetta and substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese. 
Ingredients:
2 leeks, sliced 100g cooked pancetta 2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt handful wild garlic leaves, roughly sliced 300ml double cream 100ml milk 800g potatoes, peeled & cut into slices 2-3mm thick 1-2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Sweat the leeks in butter for 10 minutes, then add the pancetta, the crushed garlic and the wild garlic leaves. Add the cream and milk and bring to the boil, then add the potatoes and seasoning and mix well. Transfer the mixture to a gratin dish, spreading it out so that there is an even distribution of cream. Cover with foil and bake in an oven for about 50 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. Remove the foil, sprinkle with the Parmesan and return to the oven for 10 minutes, until browned on top.
