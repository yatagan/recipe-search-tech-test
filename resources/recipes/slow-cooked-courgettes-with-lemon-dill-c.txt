Slow-cooked courgettes with lemon, dill and capers
Introduction:
Slow-cooked courgettes collapse into a chunky, caramel-tasting mass. This is set off beautifully by lemon zest, salty capers and mild, feathery dill. Add a little cream for a pasta sauce; spread on bruschetta for a light lunch; whizz up into soup with a little stock or eat as a simple side with fish or chicken. 
Ingredients:
6 courgettes 3 tbsp olive oil 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced zest of 2 lemons, grated 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped, plus extra to serve 10 capers, soaked in cold water for 20 mins, then squeezed dry & chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the courgettes on a slight diagonal into ovals about 8mm thick. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the courgettes in batches until lightly coloured on both sides, removing each batch as it is done (don’t put too many courgettes in the pan at once or they won’t brown). When all are done, add the garlic to the pan. Before it browns, return all the courgettes to the pan and mix well. Add the lemon zest, dill and capers and cook for about 30 minutes over a low heat, stirring occasionally. When they are done, the courgettes will be a bit mushy, but will taste great. Season well and sprinkle with the vinegar and more chopped dill.
