Potato and roasted garlic soup
Introduction:
A very simple vegan and vegetarian-friendly soup combining potatoes and onions with unctuous, slow-roasted garlic. This is delectable as is, and easily adaptable – add even more garlic if you like (roasting mellows and sweetens its taste gloriously), or substitute some of the potatoes for parsnips or celeriac, or top with crispy bacon pieces. This makes a wonderful meal with warm garlic bread for dipping. 
Ingredients:
1 large garlic head oil for roasting & frying, e.g. vegetable 1 large onion, diced 600g potatoes, peeled & diced 1 litre chicken or veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut a slice off the top of the garlic to reveal the tops of the cloves. Place on a small sheet of foil and drizzle with a little oil. Bake for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly. Gently fry the onion in 2 tablespoons of oil for 10 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the potatoes, stock and season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves into the soup. Blitz in a processor or blender until smooth. Check for seasoning.
