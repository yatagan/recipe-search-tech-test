Leek, lemon and yoghurt soup
Introduction:
The creaminess of this quick-to-make and energising vegetarian soup comes from adding yoghurt at the end of cooking. Along with the lemon, this also gives it a refreshing, citrus taste. When wild garlic leaves are in season, you could try substituting them for the leeks. 
Ingredients:
Â½ tbsp plain flour 350g full fat plain yogurt 500ml chicken or veg stock 4 medium leeks, finely sliced juice of 1-2 lemons 2 handfuls any or all: parsley, mint, dill, tarragon, chopped olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Blend the flour with a small amount of the yoghurt to make a smooth paste, then add the rest of the yoghurt and stir. Bring the stock to the boil and add the leeks. Cook briefly until leeks are tender. Stir in the yoghurt and return to the boil, then add lemon juice and seasoning to taste - the soup should taste quite lemony. Throw in the herbs and a good slug of oil and serve.
