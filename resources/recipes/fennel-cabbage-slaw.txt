Fennel and cabbage slaw
Introduction:
This refreshing, nutritious salad recipe uses raw fennel so the flavour will be fairly strongly aniseed. We specify red cabbage, but this works as well with thinly sliced green or Savoy cabbage. For a little more sweetness, include some grated apple or a small scattering of sultanas. 
Ingredients:
large fennel bulb, core removed, shredded red cabbage, core removed, shredded 1 small red onion, finely sliced zest of 1 orange 3 tbsp crème fraîche 3 tbsp plain yoghurt 3 tbsp sunflower seeds, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan on a low heat for a couple of mins
Method:
Mix the fennel, cabbage and onion together in a large bowl and season. Mix the orange zest, crème fraîche and yoghurt together in a small bowl, and stir into the fennel mixture to combine. Mix in two thirds of the sunflower seeds and sprinkle the rest over the top to serve.
