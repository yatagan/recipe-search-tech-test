Tafelspitz or Austrian boiled beef
Introduction:
Tafelspitz, allegedly Emperor Franz Joseph’s favourite dish, is to the Austro-Hungarian empire what roast beef was to the British. It traditionally uses the ‘tri tip’, or the ‘rump cap’, which good butchers should separate out because the meat grain runs in a different direction, but the method will work with topside or silverside. Serve with horseradish sauce, roast potatoes and green beans or creamed spinach. 
Ingredients:
600g cut of rump cap, silverside or topside 3 carrots, peeled & roughly chopped 2 celery sticks, roughly chopped 1 onion, cut in half, skin left on 1 bouquet garni (thyme, bay leaves, parsley stalks if you have any) a few fresh or dried mushrooms (optional)
Method:
In a casserole dish, cover the meat with water and add the rest of the ingredients. Bring the water temperature up to 140°C/Gas 1. Cook for 2 hours. While the meat is cooking, you can also add some fresh or dried mushrooms for extra richness and depth. Once the meat is cooked, carefully remove from the liquid and gently press as it cools; a carefully balanced plate with a bag of sugar will do.
