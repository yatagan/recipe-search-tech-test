Maple baked squash
Introduction:
This sweet, easy side is good served with pork chops. Alternatively, scoop out the flesh and use in a salad with some crumbled blue cheese. Or trying topping a homemade pizza with the addition of some cooked chard, spinach or rocket, with some bacon bits or prosciutto for meat eaters. 
Ingredients:
1 butternut (or other) squash, about 1.2-1.5kg 4 tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp balsamic or sherry vinegar juice of ½ lemon 2 tbsp olive oil pinch nutmeg, grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Cut the squash in half lengthways. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Cut each half into about 6 wedges, lengthways. Place in a baking tray, cut side up. In a small bowl, mix together the rest of the ingredients. Brush half the mixture over the squash. Bake for about 15 minutes. Brush the rest of the mixture evenly over the squash and cook for a further 10-15 minutes, or until the squash is cooked through.
