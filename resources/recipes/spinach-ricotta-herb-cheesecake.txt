Spinach, ricotta and herb cheesecake
Introduction:
This crustless, savoury cheesecake looks impressive and tastes even better – a light, fresh tasting alternative to a quiche. This is good warm or at room temperature, and as a starter or main. Use Pecorino rather than Parmesan if you'd like to keep it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
butter for greasing 125g walnuts, toasted then blitzed to a crumb in a food processor 1 tbsp oil for frying e.g. light olive, or a little extra butter 2 spring onions, finely chopped ½ stick wet garlic, shredded, or 2 garlic cloves, crushed 300g spinach, tough stalks removed, leaves roughly chopped if very large small handful each fresh parsley, basil & dill 3 eggs 500g ricotta 50g Parmesan or vegetarian equivalent, grated, plus more to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3. Grease a Victoria sponge size cake tin (about 20cm) well with butter. Press the walnuts around the base and sides. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil or a knob of butter in a pan, add the spring onion and garlic and fry for 1 minute. Add the spinach and fry gently for 3 minutes or so, until wilted. Put the spinach mixture, eggs, ricotta, Parmesan and herbs into a food processor. Season with salt and pepper. Pulse until combined. Bake for about 45 minutes until set. Remove, leave to cool slightly, then serve with a few Parmesan shavings and herb sprigs.
