Potato pizza
Introduction:
This Southern Italian take on pizza uses mashed potato instead of dough and is topped with a lovely combination of tomatoes, olives, anchovies and capers. It's good both hot and cold, and is far quicker and easier to make than a normal pizza. 
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, scrubbed well or peeled & chopped 150ml olive oil 1 onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 10 tomatoes, chopped handful fresh basil, shredded 100g pitted black olives 4 anchovy fillets, chopped 2 tbsp capers, rinsed & chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Boil potatoes and when cooked, drain well then mash roughly with a fork or masher with about 4 tablespoons of of the olive oil. Cook onions in a little oil for about 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes. Season well and add basil. Line an oiled oven dish with half of the potato mix. Spread with half of the tomato sauce. Sprinkle with the olives, anchovies and capers. Top with the rest of the sauce, finishing with the remaining potatoes. Drizzle with the rest of the oil and bake for 20 minutes until the top becomes golden.
