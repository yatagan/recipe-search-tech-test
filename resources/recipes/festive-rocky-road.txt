Festive rocky road
Introduction:
Sweet, rich and deliciously crunchy chocolate packed with nuts, fruit, marshmallows and biscuits. This treat is a good one for cooking with children. Vary the ingredients according to audience: we mix milk and dark chocolate together to make a rich but not bitter tasting mixture, but you can make it lighter or darker – just use good quality chocolate. Swap cranberries, glacé cherries, sultanas or raisins for dates if you prefer. 
Ingredients:
300g mixed nuts, shelled, halve walnuts, leave hazelnuts & almonds whole 6 digestive biscuits, roughly broken into pieces 16 dates, pitted & roughly chopped 100g mini marshmallows (or chop up a few large ones) 300g milk chocolate 300g dark chocolate handful of dried cranberries
Method:
Line a 4–5 cm deep tin or dish approx 30cm x 20cm (or the nearest size you have at home) with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients except the chocolate into the tin, making sure each ingredient is evenly distributed. Break up the chocolate into small pieces and place in a heatproof bowl that fits snugly over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not directly touch the water. Gently heat, without stirring, until the chocolate has melted. Stir briefly to combine the two chocolates, then pour evenly over the nut mixture. Leave to cool at room temperature, then refrigerate until firm (about 2 hours). Cut into small pieces using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Keep refrigerated in an airtight container.
