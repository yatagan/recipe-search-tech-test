Rhubarb compote
Introduction:
This compote is lovely warm and cold; with yoghurt and granola or porridge for breakfast; with custard or ice cream for dessert; and with nothing at all but a teaspoon. To take it up a notch in indulgence, pur√©e it and ripple through some double cream or custard. 
Ingredients:
500g rhubarb, chopped into 4-5cm pieces 100g golden caster or granulated sugar 50ml water 1 orange, zest & juice 1 slice beetroot (peeled) - optional
Method:
Place all the ingredients either in a wide saucepan or baking dish. Cover and simmer or bake until the rhubarb is soft but not too mushy, 10-15 mins. Remove the beetroot before eating, if using!
