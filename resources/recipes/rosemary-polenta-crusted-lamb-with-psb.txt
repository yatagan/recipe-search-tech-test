Rosemary and polenta crusted lamb with purple sprouting broccoli
Introduction:
The classic combination of rosemary and lamb really sings in this quick and nutritious dinner. If you're not keen on anchovies, you could serve the purple sprouting broccoli on its own, or with the addition of chopped black olives. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp polenta 4 lamb chops or cutlets (not too thick a cut) 2 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped 2 tbsp plain flour 1 egg, beaten a little oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 200g purple sprouting broccoli 2 anchovies, chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped salt & black pepper
Method:
Blanch the purple sprouting broccoli in a large pan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh in cold water, then drain again. Put the flour, egg and polenta in individual dishes or bowls. Mix the rosemary in with the polenta and season. Trim any excess fat off the lamb chops, then dip them in flour, then egg, then polenta, to coat. Heat a little oil in a frying pan, add the lamb and fry on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden. Remove from the pan and leave to rest. Meanwhile, heat a little oil in another pan and fry the garlic and anchovy, until the anchovy has ‘melted’. Add the purple sprouting broccoli and fry for a couple of minutes. Season to taste. Serve with the lamb.
