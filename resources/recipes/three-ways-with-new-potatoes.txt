At this time of year we’ll sometimes add a free bag of herbs to your box so keep your eyes peeled. Roast: Not just for the large fluffy tatties. Try parboiling a them before sliding into a tray of hot oil and roasting at 220˚C/200˚C fan/gas mark 8, Crispy on the outside and buttery in the middle. Try throwing with some sea salt, dried chilli, chopped rosemary and a little lemon zest. Not just for a Sunday roast. Perfect with cold cuts, a light omelette or partnered with a strong aioli and an ice cold glass of something. Rosti: Any boiled potatoes left over? Grate them on a course grater and shape them into little flat cakes. Pan-fry in a little butter and oil until golden brown on each side. Ideal for breakfast with a poached egg, wilted spinach and a shake of the pepper pot.
