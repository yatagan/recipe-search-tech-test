Mushroom dahl with radishes, rice & yoghurt
Introduction:
Cook the lentils on a low heat; if too hot they will stick to the base of the pan. Add more water if they start drying out; you want a loose, porridge-like consistency. Adding chilli at the end is optional; it adds an extra kick of heat for the more tolerant.
Ingredients:
150g red lentils 100g brown basmati rice salt & pepper 2 tomatoes 2 tablespoons medium curry powder 1 teaspoon bouillon powder 1 onion 200g portobello mushrooms 1 garlic clove oil for frying e.g. sunflower 1 bunch radishes - use ½ 15g coriander 1 teaspoon black onion seeds mushroom spice pot: 1 tablespoon curry leaves ½ teaspoon mustard seeds ½ teaspoon cumin seeds 1 lemon Yogurt, to serve
Method:
Rinse the rice, cover well with boiling water, add a good pinch of salt, pop on the lid & simmer for approx. 25 mins or until tender. Rinse the lentils to remove excess starch & tip into a saucepan. Add roughly chopped tomatoes, curry powder, bouillon powder & 600ml boiled water. Bring to a simmer. Gently cook for approx. 20-25 mins, until soft. Meanwhile, peel & finely slice the onion. Slice the mushrooms, not too thinly. Peel & finely chop 1 garlic clove. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Add the onion & a pinch of salt. Fry gently for 3-4 mins, until starting to soften. Increase the temperature, add the mushrooms & cook for 5-6 mins until both are softened & coloured. Add the garlic & the mushroom spice pot to the mushrooms, turn up the heat & fry for another 2 mins. Remove from the heat. Clean half the bunch of radishes & slice into chunky rounds or wedges. Chop the coriander leaves. Mix the radishes with the black onion seeds & half the coriander. Season with a pinch of salt. Keep to one side. When the lentils have cooked, stir in the mushrooms & remaining coriander. Season with salt & pepper to taste. A squeeze or 2 of lemon juice will enliven it too. Drain the rice & serve with the dahl, with the radishes & yoghurt on the side.
