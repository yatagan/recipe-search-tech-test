Spiced pears with raspberries
Introduction:
Towards the end of summer our raspberries are in full flush and pears are ripening on the trees. Put them together with warm spices for a light and lovely dessert. Eat this at room temperature with a generous dollop of yoghurt. Any leftover pears make a delicious breakfast treat. 
Ingredients:
4 firm pears, cored & cut in ½ 175g caster sugar 1 vanilla pod, split open 2 star anise 1 stick cinnamon, broken in half 300g raspberries plain yoghurt, to serve
Method:
Heat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Put the pears in a baking dish. In a small saucepan, gently heat the sugar and spices with 250ml water until the sugar has dissolved. Pour over the pears and bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes, until the pears are just tender. Remove from the oven, add the raspberries and leave to cool. Serve at room temperature with a dollop of yoghurt.
