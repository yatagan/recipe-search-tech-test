Romanesco, apple and hazelnut salad
Introduction:
Resplendent with verdant and hypnotic spirals, Romanesco can often be seen as simply a novelty. We find the virtues to be culinary as well as comely, sitting somewhere between broccoli and cauliflower, it can be used in place of both. 
Ingredients:
1 small Romanesco 1 small shallot 2 apples, diced 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 2 tsp Dijon mustard olive oil 100g mixed salad leaf 100g blue cheese, optional 60g hazelnuts, toasted & skinned
Method:
Put a pan of salted water on to boil. Strip away the leaves and main stalk from the Romanesco, cut into small bite sized florets. Boil for 3 minutes until lightly cooked, remove and cool. Peel and very finely dice the shallot. Make the dressing by whisking together the vinegar and mustard, slowly whisk in 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the diced shallots to the dressing. Mix the salad leaves, apples and Romanesco with the dressing. Arrange artfully on a large plate and scatter over the cheese and hazelnuts
