Grilled radicchio
Introduction:
The bitterness of the leaf is offset by the sweet balsamic for a lovely light side dish. Radicchio doesn't appear in the veg boxes more than a couple of times a year but if you're lucky enough to get it, try this recipe with grilled fish or some creamy buffalo mozzarella. 
Ingredients:
1 radicchio head 3 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp sugar 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp marjoram, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the outer leaves of the radicchio, halve it and then slice it into wedges about 1.5 cm thick, keeping the leaves joined at the core in each wedge. Whisk together all the remaining ingredients in a shallow bowl to make a dressing. Heat a ridged grill pan (or a barbecue), then grill the radicchio wedges until brown on both sides. As you remove the wedges from the griddle, place them straight in the dressing and mix well.
