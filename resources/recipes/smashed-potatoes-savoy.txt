Smashed potatoes and savoy with crème fraîche and chives
Introduction:
This rustic-looking version of classic mashed potatoes is rich in texture with lightness from the cabbage and chives and a tangy freshness from the crème fraîche. You needn't stick with Savoy cabbage here – any greens from spinach through to kale would work a treat. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & diced 1 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 25g butter 1 large or 2 small onions, finely sliced ½ large Savoy, shredded, tough core & ribs removed 4 tbsp crème fraîche handful fresh chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the potatoes in a pan of salted water until tender, about 12 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan. Add the onion. Fry on a low heat for 5 minutes, stirring now and then. Add the Savoy, season and cook for 8 minutes, stirring often, until softened. Add a splash of water now and then if it looks like it might catch. Drain the potatoes. Lightly mash them. Stir into the cabbage and onion. Add the crème fraîche and chives and gently stir. Check the seasoning.
