Roasted cauliflower biryani
Introduction:
Although biryani is traditionally served as a side to curry, it's rich and interesting enough to enjoy in its own right as a vegetarian main. Roasted cauliflower is combined with delicately spiced rice and baked in the oven. You could use brown rice for this as well – just lengthen the cooking time accordingly. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp saffron threads 2 tbsp boiling water 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 onions, sliced 2 tbsp medium to hot curry powder 200g tinned chopped tomatoes 6 cardamom pods 250g basmati rice 400ml water 1 cauliflower, cut into bite sized pieces 200ml plain yoghurt 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated 2 tsp cumin seeds handful fresh coriander leaves ½ tsp garam masala powder 4 tbsp flaked almonds
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Place the saffron threads in a small bowl and pour over a couple of tablespoons of boiling water, then leave to soak. Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a pan, add the onions and gently fry for about 10 minutes to soften. Add the curry powder, tinned tomatoes, cardamom, rice and water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 25 minutes, or until the rice is tender. While the rice is cooking, toss the cauliflower with the yoghurt, garlic and ginger, cumin seeds, coriander leaves and garam masala in a small baking dish. Roast until the cauliflower is just tender but still with some bite. Remove from the oven and add the cooked rice, along with the flaked almonds. Stir to combine, drizzle over the saffron water then cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Serve with some more plain yoghurt.
