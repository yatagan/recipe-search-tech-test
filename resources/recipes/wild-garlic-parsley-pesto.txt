Wild garlic and parsley pesto
Introduction:
This pungent pesto has many uses: toss through pasta or veg (spring greens would be good), swirl on top of soups, use on bruschetta or to stuff chicken or fish. Don't be afraid to vary the herbs or quantities according to your own taste; adding a little rosemary instead of parsley would be good with lamb. If you're vegan, make a pistou version, i.e. without pine nuts and Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
40g wild garlic leaves small handful parsley leaves 30g pine nuts, toasted 10 tbsp olive oil 30g Parmesan cheese, grated salt & pepper
Method:
In a food processor or blender, combine all the ingredients except the cheese, until the mixture is a coarse paste. Add the cheese and blitz for a few more seconds. Keep in the fridge in a sealed container or jar for up to a week or so.
