Peperonata
Introduction:
A simple, vivid and versatile veggie dish. Serve grilled on toast with a little cheese; beside a steak (lamb or beef) or pork sausages; stirred through pasta, or on top of a bed of polenta. This will keep well in the fridge for a day or two â€“ longer if kept in a jar and sealed with olive oil. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, sliced olive oil 1 garlic clove, chopped 2-3 red peppers, sliced 1 tin chopped tomatoes, drained pinch cayenne pepper salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onion in olive oil for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add garlic and peppers and cook gently for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and a pinch of cayenne pepper, then cook for another 10 minutes or so, until thick. Season, adding more cayenne if you like.
