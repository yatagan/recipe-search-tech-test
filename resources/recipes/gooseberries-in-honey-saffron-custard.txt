Gooseberries in honey saffron custard
Introduction:
With its unmistable aroma, subtle, earthy taste and beautiful hue, saffron is a wonderful addition to this unusual dessert. It's quick to prepare and makes a great end to dinner. 
Ingredients:
225g gooseberries, topped & tailed 50g caster sugar 6 egg yolks 600ml single cream 75g honey 10 saffron strands
Method:
Preheat oven to 140°C/Gas 1. Put the gooseberries in a pan with the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water, then cover and stew gently for 5 minutes or until tender. Divide between 6 ramekin dishes. Put the egg yolks, cream, honey and saffron in a bowl and whisk together just to combine. Sit the bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the base of the bowl. Cook the custard over a low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens. Strain the custard through a fine sieve over the gooseberries. Put the ramekins in a roasting tin containing about 3cm of hot water. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes–1 hour, until just set. Serve at room temperature.
