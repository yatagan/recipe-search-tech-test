Moroccan carrot salad
Introduction:
A satisfying, fresh vegetarian salad of grated carrots with a crunch of nuts and seeds, sweetness from the sultanas and a sharp lemon and cumin dressing. You don’t need to be too precise about the quantities – just taste as you go along. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch carrots 1 handful pumpkin seeds 2 tsp cumin seeds 1 handful flaked almonds 1 handful sultanas juice of 1 orange or lemon 3-4 tbsp olive oil sugar salt & pepper
Method:
Scrub or peel the carrots and grate them. Toast the pumpkin seeds, cumin and almonds in a heavy-based frying pan until golden brown. Add to a bowl with the grated carrot, sultanas, juice and oil and mix well. Season with salt, pepper and sugar to taste. You may want a little more lemon or oil too.
