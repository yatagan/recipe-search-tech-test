Tomato and wild garlic dressing
Introduction:
This very quick dressing or sauce is a good one if you've got wild garlic in your box, or have managed to forage a bunch along the wayside. It's excellent poured over white fish or chicken, or with a steaming bowl of grain or pasta. You could add a little garlic, basil, toasted pine nuts. 
Ingredients:
2 tomatoes 4 wild garlic leaves, shredded 5 tbsp olive oil juice of Â½ lemon (more to taste) salt & pepper
Method:
Cut a little cross on the top of the tomatoes. Place in a large bowl or saucepan, pour over boiling water and leave for 30 seconds. Remove from the hot water and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Peel off the skins; they should come away quite easily. Quarter the tomatoes and remove the seeds. Cut into thin strips lengthways. Place in a small saucepan with the wild garlic leaves. Add the olive oil, lemon juice and season to taste. Warm gently, taste and add a little more lemon juice if needed.
