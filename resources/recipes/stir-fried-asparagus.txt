Stir-fried asparagus
Introduction:
This quick stir-fry recipe goes well with rice, grilled fish or chicken. If you like things spicy add a generous pinch of chilli flakes. Throw in other seasonal vegetables to bulk it out – try sugar snap peas, broccoli or spinach. You can find more information here about asparagus storage and preparation – and when you can hope to get some in your veg box.
