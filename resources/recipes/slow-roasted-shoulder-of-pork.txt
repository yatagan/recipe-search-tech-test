Slow-roasted shoulder of pork with fennel, garlic and chilli
Introduction:
An old River Café wood fired oven favourite, but still good cooked in a normal oven at home. 
Ingredients:
1.3kg shoulder of pork 4 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp fennel seed 2 dried chillies, crumbled 2 tbsp olive oil 3 lemons, juiced salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 230°C/Gas mark 8. With a sharp knife score the pork, making every other score deep enough to just cut the meat. Mix the garlic, fennel seed, chilli, salt and pepper together in a mortar and pestle. If you don’t have one put the fennel seed in a plastic bag and gently bash with a rolling pin before mixing in the other ingredients. Rub into all surfaces of the meat, making sure it penetrates the score marks. Place the pork on a rack in a roasting tin and cook for 20-30 minutes, until the crackling begins to blister. Mix the olive oil and two thirds of the lemon juice. Turn the oven down to 110°C/Gas Mark &frac1/4;, turn the joint over and baste with half the lemon juice/oil mix. Cook for another 3-4 hours, turning and basting occasionally. Lift the pork onto a carving board and deglaze the pan with the remaining lemon juice. Neat carving will be a problem – it’s easier to break the crackling off and carve in thick chunks.
