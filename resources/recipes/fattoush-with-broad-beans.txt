Fattoush with broad beans
Introduction:
There's something magical about the texture, ease and complexity of a bread salad which can be adapted to whatever is seasonally available. Serve this springtime fattoush with grilled fish or as part of a mezze spread. The cumin in the dressing adds a bit of a kick but you can reduce the quantity if you prefer a more subtle effect. 
Ingredients:
2 pitta breads, torn into 2-3cm pieces 100g shelled broad beans 1 Cos or Little Gem lettuce, shredded 1 small cucumber, peeled, quartered lengthways, deseeded & cut into 1-2cm chunks 4 radishes, sliced 10 cherry tomatoes, cut in half 50g feta cheese, crumbled for the dressing: 6 mint leaves, chopped 6 tbsp olive oil 1½ tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted in a dry frying pan & then crushed a pinch of cayenne pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Spread the pieces of pitta bread out on a baking sheet, place in the oven and toast for about 5 minutes, until just crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Blanch the broad beans in boiling salted water for 2–4 minutes, depending on size, then drain. Mix together the bread, broad beans, lettuce, cucumber, radishes and cherry tomatoes. Whisk together all the ingredients for the dressing. Toss into the salad, then sprinkle with crumbled feta.
