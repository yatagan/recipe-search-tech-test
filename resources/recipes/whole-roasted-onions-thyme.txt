whole roasted onions with thyme
Introduction:
Roasted onions are rich enough for a dinner-table centrepiece. They’re also particularly good with Sunday roasts and sausages, or broken up and spread on toast, topped with slices of goat’s cheese or brie, and grilled until golden. They reheat very well, so you can make more than you need for one meal. 
Ingredients:
8 red or yellow onions, peeled but roots left intact about 50g butter 1 tbsp soft light brown sugar 2 tbsp vinegar (balsamic, sherry or red – whatever you have to hand) 100ml vegetable stock (or water) 4 thyme sprigs salt & black pepper
Method:
Heat the oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Put the onions into a baking dish, packed in fairly tightly. Melt the butter in a pan, then add the sugar, vinegar, stock and thyme and mix everything together. Pour the mix over the onions and season well with salt and pepper. Cover the dish tightly with foil and roast in the oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for a further 45 minutes or so, until the onions are sticky and starting to caramelise.
