Romanian marinated mushrooms
Introduction:
This method of cooking mushrooms emphasises how meaty they can be. This makes a great vegan starter, or a lunch or light dinner eaten on toast with a green salad, or stirred through pasta or some sturdy grain. You'll have to leave the mushrooms to chill for 12 hours before eating, so prepare in advance. 
Ingredients:
250g mushrooms 60ml olive oil 3 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp olive oil 175g onions, sliced 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped ½ tsp black pepper ¼ tsp dried thyme ½ tsp dried marjoram 3 bay leaves 1½ tins chopped tomatoes 120ml red wine vinegar ⅛ tsp cayenne ½ tsp sugar (optional)
Method:
In a large frying pan or skillet, sauté the mushrooms in the oil until just tender. Drain the mushrooms, toss with lemon juice and set aside. Add 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet and cook the onions until they begin to turn translucent. Add the garlic and continue to cook until the onions are golden, but not browned. Stir in the pepper, thyme, marjoram and bay leaves and cook for 1 minute more. Drain the tomatoes and reserve some of the juice. Coarsely chop the tomatoes and mix with the onions, reserved juice, vinegar, cayenne, salt and sugar. Simmer on a low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow the marinade to cool for several minutes and then pour over the mushrooms. Cover and chill for at least 12 hours and bring the dish to room temperature before serving. Garnish with lemon wedges and parsley.
