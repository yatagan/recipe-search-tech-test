Chargrilled leeks
Introduction:
This would work either on a barbecue or a griddle pan. To vary this recipe, you could try adding lightly toasted pinenuts or using a sweet-sour dressing made with olive oil, balsamic or red wine vinegar and a little sugar. You could also sprinkle over some feta cheese. 
Ingredients:
4 large (cut into manageable lengths) or 8 small leeks olive oil lemon juice flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Par-boil the leeks until just tender. Drain and pat dry. Heat some olive oil in a griddle pan until fairly hot. Smear a little more olive oil over the leeks and chargrill until nicely marked. Remove from pan and dress with olive oil, lemon juice, seasoning and parsley. Eat hot or cold.
