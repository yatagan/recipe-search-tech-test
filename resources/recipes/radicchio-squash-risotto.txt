Radicchio and squash risotto
Introduction:
A bowl of creamy risotto for a quick weeknight dinner. Slightly bitter radicchio makes a nice contrast to the starchiness of the rice and the sweetness of roasted squash. You could also add in a handful of sautéed mushooms, or some frozen peas. This goes down very well with a glass of white wine. Substitute the Parmesan for Pecorino to keep it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
1kg squash, peeled, deseeded & cut into 3cm chunks oil for roasting & frying, e.g. sunflower 50g butter 1 large onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed 300g risotto rice 250ml white wine 2 litres of veg stock 1 radicchio, core removed, leaves finely shredded 8-12 sage leaves, finely shredded 100g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Toss the squash in a baking dish in enough oil to coat. Season and pop in the oven while you cook the risotto, tossing once halfway through so it roasts evenly. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil and half the butter in a heavy-based pan. Add the onion. Fry on a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring now and then, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and rice. Stir for 2 minutes. Add the wine, increase the heat and let it bubble away until absorbed. Gradually add ladles of stock, stirring frequently, letting each one absorb before adding the next, for 20 minutes. Add the radicchio, sage and season. Keep adding stock and cook until the rice is tender (10-15 minutes). Add the cooked squash to the rice, with the rest of the butter and ¾ of the cheese. Leave for 2 minutes, stir. Check the seasoning. Serve sprinkled with the rest of the cheese.
