Venison tagliata (seared venison steak)
Introduction:
Tagliata is a seared steak, thinly sliced at an angle. Rump or loin, our venison is so tender that the technique works a treat. Try it with with this Scandinavian sauce of berries and warming spices. A sprinkling of mustard breadcrumbs on top rounds it off nicely. Eat with a lettuce and rocket salad with a sharp vinaigrette, or with braised greens and fondant potatoes. 
Ingredients:
3 each of cloves, juniper & allspice berries 6 peppercorns 100g raspberries or blackberries 2 tbsp sweet vinegar (raspberry, muscatel or balsamic) 2 tbsp walnut or olive oil 100ml water 4x100g venison steaks (loin medallions or rump) 150ml beef or venison stock 100ml soured cream or crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Grind the spices in a mortar and pestle, mash the berries and mix together with the spices, oil, vinegar and water. Place the venison in a shallow bowl and pour over the marinade. Turn the steaks to coat evenly. Marinate for at least 3 hours, turning every hour. Lift out the steaks with a fork, scraping off the marinade. Heat a ridged griddle pan, brush with oil and cook the steaks for 1½ minutes, turn, switch off the heat and cook the other side as the pan cools. Meanwhile, pour the marinade and beef stock into a pan, bring to the boil, reduce slightly and add the cream. Gently whisk and check the seasoning. You might want to add a splash more vinegar. Slice the meat at 45 degrees into ½ cm slices, plate up, spoon over the sauce and a sprinkling of mustard breadcrumbs (fresh breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter and mustard and browned on a tray in a 200°C/Gas 6 oven 10 minutes).
