Spiced pumpkin and coconut soup
Introduction:
This is a lovely, warming soup. The kick of the chilli is offset by the creaminess of the coconut milk and sweet roasted pumpkin. The key to success is to be patient with your roasting – caramelisation on the pumpkin pieces gives the soup an extra punch of flavour. If you'd like more of a kick, add a teaspoon or more of grated ginger at the same time as the garlic. 
Ingredients:
1kg pumpkin, skinned, deseeded & cut into large chunks olive oil 2 leeks, finely sliced 1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 red chilli, finely chopped 600ml veg or chicken stock 200ml coconut milk fresh coriander leaves, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Place your pumpkin pieces on a baking tray and toss in a little olive oil and a generous sprinkle of sea salt. Roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through and a little golden brown in places. Meanwhile, sweat the leeks off in a little olive oil for around 10 minutes until softened. Add the crushed coriander seeds, garlic and chilli and cook for another couple of minutes on a gentle heat. Add the stock and cooked pumpkin to the pan and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn the heat off and allow to cool a little. When cooled, transfer the mixture to a blender and purée until smooth. Place the mixture back into your saucepan and add the coconut milk. Heat the soup gently until piping hot. Season generously otherwise this soup can be too sweet. Dish out into warmed bowls and top with a couple of sprigs of fresh coriander.
