Sweet potato wedges with chimichurri sauce
Introduction:
Chimichurri is a punchy Argentinian sauce usually served with BBQ meat or fish. It is wonderful spooned over roast veg straight from the oven; the heat of the pan helps to take the raw edge off the garlic and release the oils from the oregano and chilli. There is very little this wouldn’t work with; wedges of roasted squash, celeriac, beetroot or carrots would work well. Fold it into roasted cauliflower, grilled leeks or even some dark wilted kale or cabbage. 
Ingredients:
2-3 large sweet potatoes 1 small shallot, very finely diced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 2 large handfuls freshly parsley, chopped 1 tsp dried oregano ¼ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 tbsp red wine vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Wash the sweet potatoes and cut them into even sized wedges. Place them in a roasting tray, oil well and season with plenty of salt and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes or until soft and coloured at the edges. To make the chimichurri, blend the remaining ingredients with 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil until you have a loose sauce. Season well. When the wedges are ready, serve them immediately with the sauce spooned liberally on top.
