Rhubarb and orange compote
Introduction:
This classic combination of rhubarb and orange is a lovely breakfast or dessert, either warm or cold. It pairs well with yoghurt, porridge and ice cream, and is also delicious on its own. Use blood oranges in season for an even more vibrant colouring. This freezes well. 
Ingredients:
500g rhubarb, cut into batons 50g sugar zest of 1 orange juice of 2 oranges
Method:
Place the rhubarb in a pan with the orange juice, zest and sugar. Cook gently until tender, about 8-10 minutes. Sieve if you want a smooth compote.
