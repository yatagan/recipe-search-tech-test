Chocolate pots
Introduction:
Chocolate pots are very quick to make but take a while to set. You could keep them very simple by leaving out the orange juice and honey; substitute a tablespoon of orange juice for a liqueur or brandy; or add in some crystallised ginger. The pots can be made well in advance and kept in the fridge until required. The mixture is very rich - it will make 4 small espresso cups. 
Ingredients:
200ml double cream 1 tsp clear honey (optional) 2 tbsp fresh orange juice 100g dark chocolate, grated or very finely chopped 1 egg yolk
Method:
In a saucepan, heat some water to simmering point. Place the cream, honey and orange juice in a bowl that sits on top of the pan, without touching the water. Gently heat the cream until it is warmed through. Remove the bowl from the heat & quickly add the chocolate and egg yolk. Stir through until the chocolate has melted and the egg yolk combined - be careful not to over mix or the texture will become grainy. When smooth, spoon or pour the mixture into espresso cups, ramekins or small bowls and leave to cool for 10 minutes, then chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Remove the pots from the fridge a few minutes before serving.
