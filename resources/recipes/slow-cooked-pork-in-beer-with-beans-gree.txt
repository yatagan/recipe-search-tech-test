Slow-cooked pork in beer with beans and greens
Introduction:
This is a delectable, well-balanced one-pot pork dinner. The greens and beans absorb the taste of the meat beautifully. It calls for a long cooking time, but it's quick to get into the oven, and once it's there no little further attention is needed. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1.5kg pork joint suitable for slow cooking, e.g. shoulder or neck 2 onions, sliced 3-4 rashers streaky bacon, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp caraway seeds (or fennel seeds, or a mix of the two) 350ml beer 350ml chicken stock 200g dried haricot (or other white) beans, rinsed & drained 300g kale or cabbage, tough stalks removed, leaves shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. In a large, flameproof casserole, heat about 1-2 tablespoons of oil and fry the pork on all sides until browned. Remove and leave to one side. Add the onion and bacon, and fry until the bacon starts to brown. Add the garlic, caraway or fennel seeds and fry for another minute. Return the pork to the pan, add the beer, stock and beans, and then season. Bring to the boil, cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for about 2-2½ hours, until the meat and beans are tender. Add the greens and cook on the hob, stirring occasionally, for a few more minutes, until they have wilted. Check seasoning and serve.
