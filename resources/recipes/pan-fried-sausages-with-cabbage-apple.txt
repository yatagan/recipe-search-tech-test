Pan-fried sausages with cabbage and apple
Introduction:
A good, easy weeknight dinner. Cooking everything in the same pan not only saves on washing up but means the onions and cabbage absorb the meaty flavour from the sausages. You can oven-roast the sausages if you prefer and cook the onion, cabbage and apple as below. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 8 pork sausages, pricked with a fork 1 onion, red or white, very thinly sliced 1 large apple, cored & thinly sliced 1 medium cabbage (any variety), quartered, cored & thinly shredded splash cider vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
In a large frying pan heat a little oil and fry the sausages until cooked through. Remove from the pan and add the onions, which will soak up the sausage juices. Cook until translucent, adding a little more oil if they start to burn, until the onions begin to brown. Add the apples, fry for another minute or two. Add the cabbage, salt and pepper to season, a splash of cider vinegar, and a little water. Increase the heat, cook, stirring constantly, for a few minutes until the cabbage has softened but still has some bite. Check the seasoning and serve.
