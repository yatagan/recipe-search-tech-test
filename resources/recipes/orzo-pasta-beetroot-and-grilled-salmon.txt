Orzo pasta with grilled salmon
Introduction:
A nutritious, texture-rich dinner of pasta tossed with crunchy grated carrots and beets, and served alongside quick-grilled salmon fillets. If you don't have orzo (small, rice-shaped pasta), use another small shape, or make this with quinoa for a gluten-free version. 
Ingredients:
150g orzo or other small pasta shape 2 carrots, coarsely grated 1 large beetroot, coarsely grated handful dill leaves, roughly chopped zest & juice of ½ lemon, more to taste 2 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil ½ tsp raspberry balsamic vinegar, optional 2 salmon fillets salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the orzo in salted boiling water for 8 minutes Drain, toss in a splash of oil to stop it sticking, and leave to cool. Mix the carrot, beetroot, dill, lemon zest and juice, olive oil and vinegar (if using) in a bowl. Season. Mix in the cooled pasta (don’t over-mix or the pasta will turn completely pink). Taste and add more lemon juice and seasoning if needed. Heat your grill and line the tray with foil. Place the salmon on the tray and season with salt and pepper. Grill for about 3-4 minutes for a 2-3cm thick piece. Serve with the salad.
