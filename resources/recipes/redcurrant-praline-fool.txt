Redcurrant and praline fool
Introduction:
Serve this luxuriant, creamy fool in individual small glasses or one bowl. You could add some broken up meringue to the mixture to make a redcurrant Eton mess. If you want to make more praline or have some left over, it will keep for quite a while stored between sheets of greaseproof paper in an airtight container. 
Ingredients:
for the praline: 100g caster sugar 50g pecans, pistachios or hazelnuts, roughly chopped for the fool: 200g redcurrants, green stalks removed 4 tbsp caster sugar 450ml double cream
Method:
Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. To make the praline, place the sugar in a small non-stick pan and gently heat without stirring until the mixture turns a deep caramel colour (donâ€™t let it go too dark brown, or it will taste bitter). Add the nuts, stir in very quickly, remove from the heat and immediately pour onto the greaseproof paper. Spread out as thinly as you can with a spatula. Leave to cool. Chop into pieces or shards, or alternatively blitz to a rough crumb in a food processor. Leave to one side. To make the fool, place the redcurrants in a small saucepan with the caster sugar and a tablespoon of water. Heat gently until the sugar has melted and the redcurrants are starting to break down. Remove from the heat, then leave to cool. In a large bowl, whisk the cream until it forms soft peaks. Fold in the redcurrant mixture, reserving a spoonful of the redcurrants for garnishing. Place in the fridge for about 10 minutes to firm up a little, then serve sprinkled with the reserved redcurrants and praline.
