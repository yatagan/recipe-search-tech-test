Slightly Sicilian slow roast pork
Introduction:
Slow roast pork is a sure-fire winner whether finished in the oven, on the BBQ or given the Dixie treatment of cooking to the point of disintegration, and pulling apart with fingers or forks. Crackling is always a bit of a lottery with slow roasting, so the joy of a rindless joint is that if it’s not there, you don’t have to worry about it. 
Ingredients:
800g pork spare rib 1 lemon, roughly chopped with skin on 2 tbsp fennel seed 6 tbsp olive oil 4 garlic cloves ½ tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp salt good pinch pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas Mark ½. Put all the ingredients apart from the pork in a food processor and blitz to a rough purée; rind, pith and juice from the lemon all bring something different to the party. Smear over the meat, wrap loosely in foil, place on a roasting tray and cook for 2 hours. Take out of the oven and unwrap. At this point you can either turn the oven up to 200°C/Gas Mark 6, baste the meat with the juices from the foil and cook for another 20 minutes, or if it happens to be a warm summer evening, finish over the BBQ.
