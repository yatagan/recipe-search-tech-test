Spring onion and chilli cheese omelette
Introduction:
Don't leave the last spring onion languishing in the fridge – use it to pep up an omelette for a quick lunch or supper. This is an easily adapted formula: throw in a few cooked broccoli florets if you have them, or some green beans or sliver of courgette. 
Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten 1 tbsp sunflower oil (or other oil suitable for light frying) 1 spring onion, finely chopped ½ fresh red chilli, de-seeded & chopped, or a pinch of dried ground chilli or flakes 25g Cheddar, grated
Method:
In a bowl, season the beaten eggs with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a small frying pan. Add the spring onion and chilli and fry for a few seconds. Add the eggs and keep them moving around the pan with a fork until three quarters cooked. Sprinkle over the cheese. Carefully fold the omelette over with a palette or spatula and serve.
