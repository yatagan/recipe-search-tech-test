Introduction:
For sheer satisfaction it's hard to beat the combination of bacon, leeks and Jerusalem artichokes – but the sizzled sage is the icing on the cake. This healthy recipe is rustled up in less than half an hour, making it an excellent weeknight dinner. 
Ingredients:
500g Jerusalem artichokes, peeled & thickly sliced 2 leeks, sliced at an angle into 2.5cm lengths 3 streaky bacon rashers, chopped 1 tbsp lemon juice 4 tbsp olive oil handful of sage leaves, coarsely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the artichokes in a pan of boiling salted water and simmer briskly for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, steam the leeks for 3 minutes, until they are just tender and still bright green. Fry the bacon over a moderate to high heat until brown and crisp. Drain the artichokes, put them in a warmed serving bowl and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Scatter the leeks and bacon over the top and season with salt and plenty of pepper. Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan until very hot. Add the sage and sizzle for 30 seconds – it will crisp up as it cools. Pour the oil and sage over the vegetables and serve straight away.
