Lentil and fennel salad
Introduction:
These lentils are brilliant as a warmed up packed lunch with a green salad. 
Ingredients:
good bunch parsley, leaves & stems separated 500g dark green lentils (puy or similar), rinsed & soaked in water for 30 mins 2 bay leaves 2 garlic cloves, smashed 2 tsp salt, plus more as needed 1 small fennel bulb, trimmed 4 tbsp olive oil 3 medium carrots, peeled & finely diced 2 medium red onions, finely chopped 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, plus more as needed handful parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Tie the parsley stems together with string and place in a large saucepan. Add the lentils, bay leaf, and garlic and cover by 2 inches with cold water. Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat; about 10 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon of the salt, stir to combine, and continue to simmer until the lentils are just tender - about another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop the fennel bulb. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan and add the chopped fennel, carrots, onions, and a pinch each of salt and pepper and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until the carrots are al-dente. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed. Transfer the mixture to a large heatproof bowl. Carefully remove the parsley stem bundle, bay leaf, and garlic from the lentils and discard. Drain the lentils and transfer to the bowl with the carrot mixture. Add the mustard, vinegar, the remaining olive oil and salt and stir to combine. Taste and re-season with more salt, pepper, and vinegar if needed. Stir in the chopped parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature with the best bread you can find, some shredded lamb, a green salad and, if you can be bothered, an Italian salsa verde.
