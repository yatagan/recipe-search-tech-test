Potato and spring onion fishcakes
Introduction:
These fish cakes make a good, simple weeknight dinner. You could use tinned salmon in place of fresh, and sweet potatoes in place of normal ones (though the texture will be softer). They go well with salad, quick-wilted greens, or asparagus or beans in the summer. Use Japanese panko breadcrumbs if you can find them; they give a particularly good crunchy texture. 
Ingredients:
400g fresh salmon fillet 450g potatoes, peeled & diced zest & juice of 1 lemon 2 spring onions, finely sliced (use green & white parts) 1 heaped tsp wholegrain mustard small handful fresh dill & parsley (or just use one), chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 150g dried breadcrumbs 2 tbsp plain flour 1-2 eggs, beaten oil for frying, e.g. sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Heat oven to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Place the salmon fillet on a baking tray and roast for about 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave until cool enough to flake (removing any skin and bones). While the salmon is cooking, boil the potatoes in salted water until cooked through. Drain and mash. Place the salmon and mashed potato in a large bowl and add the lemon zest and juice, spring onions, mustard, herbs and olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Gently combine all the ingredients together. Form the mixture into eight equal sized balls, then flatten a little into a patty shape. Place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes if you have time, to firm up a little. Put the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in 3 separate bowls. Dip the fishcakes in each bowl, in that order, to coat. Heat about 4 tablespoons of sunflower oil in a large frying pan and gently fry the fishcakes for a few minutes until golden brown on each side. Cook in batches if needs be and keep warm in the oven. Drain on kitchen paper.
