Grilled leeks with cheese
Introduction:
This topping will liven up the last couple of leeks in your veg box. It’s good served with chicken or pork. Substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese for vegetarians – either Pecorino or a pungent blue cheese works well. 
Ingredients:
2 medium leeks, cut into 4cm lengths large knob of butter, softened 1 tbsp Parmesan, freshly grated 1 tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the leeks in boiling, salted water for 8-10 minutes. Drain them and transfer to a shallow ovenproof dish. Cream the butter, cheese and mustard together, season and spread the mixture over the leeks. Grill under a high heat until golden.
