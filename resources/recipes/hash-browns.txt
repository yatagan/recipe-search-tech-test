Hash browns
Introduction:
Crisp, buttery and delicious additions to breakfast, brunch or dinner. This should make about 8 hash browns. You can leave out the peeling if you're using young, thin-skinned potatoes. Make sure you season well before mixing: this works better than seasoning after frying. 
Ingredients:
500g potatoes, peeled & grated 1 small onion, grated 1½ tbsp butter 1½ tbsp plain flour, sifted oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Put the grated potato in a large colander and wash well to remove the starch. Drain, put in a tea towel and squeeze out any excess moisture. In a large bowl, mix the onion and potato. Season well. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and mix the melted butter and flour into the potato mixture. Mould the mixture into flat patty shapes. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan and fry the hash browns on both sides for a few minutes, until golden brown. Press them with the back of a spoon as they cook to flatten them further.
