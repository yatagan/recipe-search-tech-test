Red cabbage salad with beetroot, blue cheese & crispy chestnuts 
Introduction:
This bright winter salad with buttery chestnuts, creamy cheese and tangy apple is good enough to eat on its own. Macerating the raw cabbage and beetroot in the spiced dressing allows the veg to soften and take on some extra flavour. If you don’t have chestnuts, walnuts or even toasted seeds would work well too. 
Ingredients:
zest & juice of 1 orange 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard 1 tsp allspice 1 tsp caraway seeds olive or hazelnut oil 1 beetroot, peeled & cut into matchsticks ½ red cabbage, core removed, shredded 40g cranberries 25g butter 1 pack pre-cooked chestnuts, roughly chopped 1 apple, core removed, halved & thinly sliced 75g blue cheese salt & pepper
Method:
In a large bowl, mix the orange zest, vinegar, mustard, allspice, caraway seeds, 2 tablespoons of orange juice and 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the beetroot, cabbage and cranberries. Season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Set aside and allow to macerate. After 10 minutes, heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan. When the butter is bubbling, add the chestnuts. Fry for 3-4 minutes, until crisp at the edges. Season the cabbage and beetroot to taste. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a serving platter or large plate. Hold back the juices. Top with the apple slices and chestnuts. Crumble over the blue cheese.
