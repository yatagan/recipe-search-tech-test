Leek risotto
Introduction:
A simple, undemanding dinner, this comforting risotto can be eaten on its own, or with a bitter leaf salad, or topped with a runny-yolked fried or poached egg. It works especially well with winter leeks, as their taste is strongest. Throw in a handful of mushrooms if you've got any.
Ingredients:
25g butter 4 leeks, thinly sliced 1Â½ litres vegetable stock 350g risotto rice 175ml single cream salt & pepper 25g Parmesan or vegetarian alternative, grated
Method:
Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water and simmer for another 5 minutes, adding more water if necessary. Meanwhile bring the stock to the boil in another pan. Stir the rice into the leeks. Add a ladleful of the hot stock and cook, stirring, until it has been absorbed. Continue adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stirring until each addition has been absorbed. This will take about 20 minutes. When the rice is tender, stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with the Parmesan.
