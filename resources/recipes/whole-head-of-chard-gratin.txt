Whole head of chard gratin
Introduction:
This dish is a French classic usually made with spinach rather than chard. It could be a side to a weekend roast or to weekday baked potatoes; a bed for poached eggs; or just a standalone meal with a little bread or brown rice to soak up the cream. Use an alternative to Parmesan to make it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
1 whole head of chard 40g butter, plus a little extra 1 onion, finely sliced 25g plain flour 150ml milk a little nutmeg, grated a small handful grated hard cheese eg. 25g Parmesan or Gruyère, grated (optional) 25g dried breadcrumbs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Cut a small slice off the chard base to release the leaves. Cut out each white stem in a v-shape, then chop them into 1-2cm pieces. Keep the leaves as they are. Cook the chard stems in a large pan of salted boiling water for 3 minutes. Add the chard leaves and cook for a further 3 minutes. Drain, refresh in a large bowl of ice cold water, then drain again. Gently squeeze out the excess liquid and keep to one side. Melt the butter in a heavy-based pan. Add the onion and fry on a very low heat until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the flour and stir for 2 minutes. Add the milk and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, to thicken slightly. Add the chard and toss to coat. Add a little more milk if the mixture gets too thick. Check the seasoning, and spread the chard mixture evenly in a greased baking dish, sprinkle with cheese and breadcrumbs and bake until golden, about 25 minutes.
