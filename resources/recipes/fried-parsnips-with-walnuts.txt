Fried parsnips with walnuts
Introduction:
Parsnips taste sweeter as the soil temperature drops – the starch in them turns to sugar – so they'll be at their best just after a cold snap. These tender morsels are lovely with roast game or warm ham, or tossed in a winter salad. 
Ingredients:
450g small parsnips 15g light muscovado sugar ⅕ tsp cinnamon 40g butter 25g walnuts, chopped 1 tbsp white wine vinegar fresh parsley, chopped, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the parsnips and boil in lightly salted water until almost tender. Drain well, cut each one in half, and then cut the thicker part into quarters lengthwise. Mix the sugar with the cinnamon. Melt the butter in a wide pan and add the parsnips and walnuts. Fry gently, stirring and turning, until the parsnips are lightly patched with brown. Scatter with sugar and cinnamon, stir to distribute evenly, then drizzle over the vinegar and salt and pepper. Cook for a final minute and serve, scattered with parsley.
