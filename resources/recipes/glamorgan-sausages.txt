Glamorgan sausages
Introduction:
This old Welsh recipe uses traditional leeks and sharp and creamy caerphilly cheese for a vegetarian alternative to bangers. Serve with mash and gravy if you like. With a bowl of roasted carrots or parsnips with honey and mustard, these are particularly good for dinner, or eat them with baked beans for brunch. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing 15g butter 2-3 leeks, finely shredded, washed to remove any grit, then drained (you need 350g shredded weight) 1 tbsp fresh or 1 tsp dried thyme leaves 150g breadcrumbs, plus an extra 100g for coating 150g Caerphilly cheese, crumbled 2 eggs, beaten
Method:
Heat the oil and butter in a heavy-based pan. Add the leeks and thyme and season. Fry on a low heat, occasionally stirring, for 8-10 minutes, until softened but not coloured. Remove from the heat. Stir in the breadcrumbs and cheese. Gradually add some of the egg, a dessertspoon at a time until the mixture just holds together. Use your hands to form the mixture into 8 even-sized sausage shapes. Roll each in the remainder of the beaten egg, then the extra breadcrumbs, until coated. Place on a non-stick baking tray, lightly greased with a little oil. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until crisp and golden.
