St John spinach
Introduction:
This is a recipe inspired by the second St John cookbook. It goes with everything; you’ll never have any leftover at the end of the meal. The original recipe deals in handfuls and dollops so we’ve tried to be more precise in the measurements, but don’t be afraid to tweak. It may look green and healthy but this is a luxury. Perfect with a roasted leg of spring lamb or stirred through a bowl of dark lentils. Fergus, we salute you.
Ingredients:
250g spinach, washed butter or oil 2-3 tsp Dijon mustard 80g hard sheep’s cheese or Parmesan, grated 1 tbsp crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Remove any tough stalks from the spinach and cook it down gently in a little butter or olive oil until just wilted, but still green and vibrant. Pop in a food processor with all the other ingredients and blend into a purée. Add a pinch of pepper and salt if it needs it. Serve warm.
