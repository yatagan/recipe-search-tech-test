Jerusalem artichokes with bacon (or mushrooms), paprika and breadcrumbs
Introduction:
Sweet and nutty, subtly perfumed Jerusalem artichokes pair beautifully with crispy bacon, crunchy breadcrumbs and smoky paprika in this easy side. For a vegetarian alternative, sliced mushrooms make a good substitute for the bacon. This dish goes well with roast chicken or game.
Ingredients:
750g Jerusalem artichokes, peeled juice of Â½ lemon 2 tsp paprika 1 tbsp olive or sunflower oil 100g streaky bacon or pancetta, diced 3 tbsp fine dry breadcrumbs salt & pepper
Method:
Steam or simmer the artichokes in lightly salted water, acidulated with the lemon juice, until just cooked (but not soft and mushy). Sprinkle the peeled artichokes evenly with a little salt and all the paprika, rolling them around so that they are fairly evenly coated. Heat the oil in a medium-sized frying pan. Add the pancetta or bacon and fry over a high heat until crisp and brown. Scoop out with a slotted spoon, letting as much fat as possible drain back into the pan. Drain the pancetta or bacon on kitchen paper. Add the breadcrumbs to the pan and fry until golden brown, then scoop them out and put to one side before adding the hot artichokes to the pan and, if necessary, a touch more oil. Fry over a high heat for a couple of minutes, turning carefully, until piping hot. Tip into a warm serving dish and scatter with the breadcrumbs and pancetta or bacon.
