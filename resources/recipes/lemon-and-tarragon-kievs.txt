Lemon and tarragon kievs
Introduction:
Chicken kievs are a family favourite and are easy and satisfying to make. Lemon and tarragon is just as good as the more traditional garlic butter filling. 
Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts sunflower oil for the herb butter filling: 60g butter (at room temperature) 2 garlic cloves ½ lemon, zested & juiced 1 tbsp tarragon, chopped for the coating: 2 tbsp plain white flour 1 egg, beaten 100g breadcrumbs
Method:
Peel off the chicken skin and remove the loose piece of under fillet. Put the breasts in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up. Meanwhile make the herb butter: Combine the butter with all the other ingredients and season well. Roll up in clingfilm into a chipolata-shaped sausage and freeze for about 30 minutes to firm up (this can be done well in advance), then keep chilled in the fridge. Using a thin knife, make a hole at the thin end of the breasts and push until you almost reach the other end to create a long pocket. Push in a slice of the hard herb butter. Coat each breast by coating in flour, then dipping in egg and finally coating in breadcrumbs. Repeat to ensure a good coating of breadcrumbs to stop the butter from oozing out later. Put in the fridge for an hour. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Gently brush each breast with sunflower oil and bake for 25 minutes until golden brown. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes, then slice diagonally into 1-2cm slices. If you have any herb butter left over, use it in a baked chicken dish for the legs and wings. Simply fry the chicken in 1 tablespoon of butter until brown. Transfer to a loose fitting casserole and add a quarter of a lemon in halved slices, 1 tablespoon of herb butter and salt and pepper. Bake at 180°C/Gas Mark 4 for 30 minutes with the lid off.
