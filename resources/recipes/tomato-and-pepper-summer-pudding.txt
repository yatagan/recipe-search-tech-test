Tomato and pepper summer pudding
Introduction:
Summer pudding is an English classic – and this savoury take makes a succulent, refreshing alternative to sugary berries. Serve this cold after putting it in the fridge overnight. Eat with a green salad and any other summery accompaniments you fancy – boiled eggs and olives are both good. 
Ingredients:
6-10 thin slices slightly stale white bread, crusts removed fresh herbs (parsley & basil) to decorate for the filling: 2 onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1 red pepper, deseeded & cut into strips 1 green pepper, deseeded & cut into strips 3 tbsp olive oil 2x400g tin tomatoes or 1kg fresh tomatoes, skinned & roughly chopped 2 tbsp tomato purée 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 1 tsp dried 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 2 tsp sugar salt & pepper
Method:
Make the filling first. Cook the onions, garlic and peppers gently in the oil until tender. Add all the remaining ingredients and simmer until fairly thick. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove the thyme sprigs. Line a 900ml-1.2 litre pudding basin with the bread, trimming so that it fits snugly with no gaps but no overlaps either. Fill with the tomato and pepper mixture and cover with bread trimmed to fit. Lay a plate or large saucer on top and weigh down with tins or metal weights. Leave overnight in the fridge. Just before serving remove weight and plate, and cover the pudding with a shallow serving dish. Invert, give it a firm shake and the pudding should slip nicely out onto the plate. Decorate with fresh herbs.
