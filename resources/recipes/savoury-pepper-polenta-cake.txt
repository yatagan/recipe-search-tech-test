Savoury pepper polenta cake
Introduction:
Serve this savoury polenta cake for dinner with some mixed roasted vegetables, greens or mushrooms braised in a little garlic and olive oil, or all three. You can also eat it cold for a picnic or lunch; try cutting it in half and spreading with cream cheese topped with salad leaves, like an open sandwich. 
Ingredients:
150g self-raising flour 175g polenta 125g Cheddar cheese, grated (or use another hard mature-flavoured cheese) 2 eggs 250ml plain yoghurt 125ml milk 50g butter, melted 1 red pepper, deseeded & finely chopped 1-2 chillies, depending on strength, deseeded & finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Lightly butter a 20cm spring-form cake tin and line with baking parchment. In a large bowl, combine the flour, polenta and cheese. Season well. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, yoghurt, milk and melted butter. Stir in the pepper and chilli. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until all are just combined. Pour the mixture into the tin and bake in the oven for about 30 minutes, until set and an inserted skewer or cocktail stick comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly before taking out of the tin.
