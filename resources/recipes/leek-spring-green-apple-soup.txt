Leek, spring green and apple soup
Introduction:
This unusual soup brings together sweet-cooked onions and leeks with cider, apples and shredded spring greens for a fresh and lovely finish. Leave chunky or blend smooth depending on your preference, and if you aren't a vegetarian definitely top with salty, smoky lardons of bacon for contrast. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, finely sliced 600g leeks (about 3-4 large), finely shredded 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 apples, peeled & diced 250ml cider 1 litre veg stock 100g spring greens, finely shredded 150g smoked bacon pieces, fried (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the butter and oil in a large pan. Add the onion and leeks. Fry on a low heat for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and apple and cook for 2 minutes. Add the cider and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the stock, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the spring greens and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the greens are tender. Blitz until smooth or leave chunkier, whichever you prefer. Season, and serve with the cooked bacon pieces scattered over the top.
