Ham hock, leek & sprout beanpot
Introduction:
Our ham hock is made in our own farm kitchen. It tastes great and makes up part of this simple, veg-packed, one-pot dish. With our ready-made chicken stock to add extra flavour, this warming supper will be on the table in n0 time.
Ingredients:
1 large or 2 smaller leeks 1 large or 2 small carrots 2 celery sticks oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or light olive 1 tsp dried thyme 200g Brussels sprouts 30g fresh parsley 500ml chicken stock 150g pulled ham hock 1 tin of cannellini beans 1 tbsp Dijon mustard – add to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Trim the top and bottom of the leek(s) and cut in half lengthways. Finely shred each half. Wash to remove any grit. Wash and peel the carrot(s). Wash the celery sticks. Finely chop both carrot and celery into approximately 1cm dice. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a heavy-based pan. Add the leek, carrot and celery. Fry on a low heat for 10 minutes or so to soften them, stirring now and then to stop them catching. If they do look like catching, add a splash of water and turn the heat lower. While the veg cooks, peel the outer leaves off the Brussels sprouts. Cut them in half through the stalk base so they hold together, then finely shred each half, discarding the stalk bases. Wash the parsley. After 10 minutes, add the thyme to the veg. Stir for 1 minute. Add the chicken stock. Season with a little pepper. Bring up to a low boil. Cook for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, rinse the cannellini beans in a colander until the water runs clear. Roughly chop the parsley leaves. After 5 minutes, add the ham hock, shredded sprouts and beans to the pan. Stir and simmer for 5 minutes or so to warm the beans through and wilt the shredded sprouts. Stir in mustard to your liking (you needn’t use all of it) and the chopped parsley. Check the seasoning before serving.
