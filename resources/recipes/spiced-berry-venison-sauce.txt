Spiced berry venison sauce
Introduction:
The quantities are small so if you pair it with a rich sauce it shouldn’t leave you too bloated, and this really is a celebration sauce. To make it even more so, substitute the water for full red wine or port. The breadcrumbs add a nice bit of crunch. 
Ingredients:
1 each cloves, juniper & allspice berries (sounds stingy, but it’s enough) 3 peppercorns 50g raspberries or blackberries (frozen will do) 1 tbsp sweet vinegar (raspberry, muscatel or balsamic) 1 tbsp walnut or strong olive oil 50ml water 2x100g venison steaks 75ml beef or venison stock 50ml soured cream or crème fraîche 2 tbsp mustard breadcrumbs (details in the recipe below) salt & pepper
Method:
Grind the spices and peppercorns in a mortar and pestle, then mash the berries and mix together with the spices, oil, vinegar and water. Place the venison steaks in a shallow bowl and pour over the marinade. Turn the steaks to coat evenly. Marinate for at least 3 hours, turning every hour. Lift out the steaks with a fork, scraping off the marinade. Heat a ridged griddle pan, brush with oil and cook the steaks for 1½ minutes, turn, switch off the heat and cook the other side as the pan cools. This will cook to just rare or medium rare. If you prefer it cooked through, cook for longer. Meanwhile, pour the marinade and beef stock into a pan, bring to the boil, reduce until beginning to thicken, sieve, return to pan and add the cream. Gently whisk and check the seasoning. You might want to add a splash more vinegar plus salt and pepper. Plate up the steaks, spoon over the sauce and a sprinkling of mustard breadcrumbs (fresh breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter and mustard and browned on a tray in a 200°C/Gas Mark 6 oven for 10 minutes).
