Ratatouille 
Introduction:
Ratatouille comes into its own in the summer months when courgettes, tomatoes and peppers are flush in the fields. Oven-baking turns them into a soft, rich mass that has many uses. Make lots and eat warm with bread, stirred through pasta or on top of a pile of sturdy grain. 
Ingredients:
olive oil 2 onions, chopped 4 garlic cloves, chopped 4 large tomatoes 3 courgettes, cubed 2 aubergines, cubed 2 peppers, cubed handful fresh basil leaves, torn salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Pour a little olive oil into a pan over the heat. Add the onions and then the garlic until soft. In a large roasting tin add tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines and peppers to the onions and garlic. Season the vegetables and roast for 45 minutes. Mix the vegetables together with torn basil or parsley and a drizzle of olive oil.
