Leek and goats cheese tart with thyme
Introduction:
Easily assembled, this tart is good warm or cold and makes for a great light summer lunch or dinner alongside a crisp green salad. Rocket leaves go particularly well. If you're not partial to goat's cheese, substitute feta; and it you'd rather make it vegetarian, use a hard cheese other than Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
400g shortcrust pastry 400g leeks, halved & sliced 1 medium onion, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 3 eggs 285ml single cream or creme fraiche thyme leaves 200g goats cheese, crumbled 25g Parmesan, freshly grated grated nutmeg
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Roll out pastry to line a 23cm tart tin. Allow to rest in fridge for 30 minutes. Blind bake in the oven for about 15 minutes, until light brown. Stew leeks and onion in the oil until soft and combine with all ingredients except goats cheese and thyme. Pour into pastry case, then sprinkle goats cheese over; with a few leaves of thyme. Bake for about 20 minutes.
