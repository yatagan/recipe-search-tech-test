Purple sprouting broccoli, mozzarella and tomato bake
Introduction:
This vegetarian bake of broccoli, juicy tomatoes, sweet leek and creamy mozzarella cooks in less than half an hour, making an excellent weeknight dinner. It's particularly good with purple sprouting broccoli when it's in season, otherwise use Calabrese. Serve with quinoa or couscous. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 small leek, sliced 350-400g purple sprouting broccoli 200g cherry tomatoes, halved 200g mozzarella, roughly torn 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh marjoram or oregano leaves (or use 1 tsp dried) 2 tbsp breadcrumbs olive oil for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the leek and cook gently for 8 minutes to soften. Steam or boil the broccoli for 2 minutes. Drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water. Drain again. Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Toss the broccoli in a shallow baking dish with the leeks, tomatoes, mozzarella, garlic and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter over the breadcrumbs. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese has melted. Drizzle over a little olive oil to serve.
