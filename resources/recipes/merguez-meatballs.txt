Merguez meatballs
Introduction:
A great go-to recipe for when the sun comes out and the barbecues are fired up. 
Ingredients:
500g minced lamb 50g fresh breadcrumbs 2 heaped tbsp flat leaf parsley, chopped 1 egg 2 tsp cumin 1 tsp harissa salt & pepper
Method:
Combine all the ingredients in a food processor or with your hands, and cook a little nugget up to make sure you are happy with the seasoning. Form into balls and cook on the BBQ. The more you mix, the more solid the texture will be, so donâ€™t get carried away.
