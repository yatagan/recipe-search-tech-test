Teriyaki pork stir-fry with spring greens, shiitake & brown rice
Introduction:
Don’t let the name fool you, what we call spring greens are hardy, tolerate cold winters and supply some much needed greens through the darker months. In this dish we are using them in place of the traditional pak choi or morning glory leaves you’d be likely to see in a stir-fry.
Ingredients:
150g brown basmati rice 25g ginger 2 garlic cloves 1 red chilli 1 red onion 2 tbsp sesame oil 150g shiitake mushrooms 1 tbsp sesame seeds 200g spring greens 300g pork stir-fry strips 3 tbsp teriyaki sauce salt & pepper
Method:
Put a large pan of salted water onto boil. Rinse the rice well under cold running water in the sieve. When the water is boiling add the rice. Stir briefly and drop to a simmer. Cook, partially covered, for 20-25 minutes, until tender. Peel the ginger and garlic, finely grate or chop them both. Deseed and finely chop the chilli. Peel and finely slice the red onion. Cut or tear the mushrooms into thin strips. Season the pork well with salt and pepper. Wash the spring greens and shake them dry. Cut the leaves away from the tough central stalks. Discard the stalks and roughly slice the green leaves. Put the wok/frying pan onto the heat, add the sesame seeds and gently toast them until they just start to colour and smell fragrant. Keep them moving and make sure they don’t burn. Tip them out and keep to one side. Turn up the wok/frying pan until very hot. Add 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and fry the mushrooms and onions fiercely for 2 minutes, stirring often. Add the pork, garlic, ginger and chilli. Cook for a further 1 minute until the pork has browned a little. Keep everything moving in the pan. Add the spring greens and cook for a further 2 minutes, until wilting. Add the teriyaki sauce and 2 tablespoons of water to the pan. Simmer for a further 1 minute. Drain the rice and divide it between 2 bowls. Top with the pork mixture and garnish with toasted sesame seeds.
