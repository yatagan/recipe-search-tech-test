Chicken with garlic confit and mash
Introduction:
A comforting dinner or Sunday lunch of smoky fried chicken served atop mashed potatoes mixed with the pungent sweetness of garlic confit. Garlic poached this way is meltingly tender and mellow tasting. Both it and the oil it’s cooked are a welcome addition to any number of veggie dishes. If you want to make extra, keep the cloves covered in the oil and they’ll store well at room temperature for several weeks. 
Ingredients:
6 garlic cloves 2 bay leaves 6 tbsp olive oil 4 chicken quarters, breasts cut into 3, wings jointed, thighs halved 1 tsp smoked paprika, preferably picante 100ml fino sherry 1kg floury potatoes salt & pepper
Method:
Gently cook the unpeeled garlic, bay leaves and olive oil in a small saucepan with the lid on. When cooked (very soft), remove the garlic and bay leaves, peel and save the garlic. Transfer the oil to a large, heavy frying pan and turn up the heat. Season the chicken and fry for about 5 minutes a side until the skin begins to crisp. Turn the heat down and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the paprika and sherry and give everything a good stir. Lid and cook for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the mash. Peel the potatoes, cut into chunks and cook in salted water with the garlic. Drain the potatoes and mash with the oil and garlic. Season to taste. Serve the chicken and juices on top of the mash with the garlic confit.
