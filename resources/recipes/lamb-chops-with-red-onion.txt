Lamb chops with red onion
Introduction:
A quick and unfussy lamb chop dinner. Don't over cook lamb or it will be leathery; aim instead for browned chops that are succulently pink inside. Serve with a sprinkling of chopped parsley, seasonal greens and mash. 
Ingredients:
2 large red onions, halved & thinly sliced 4 tbsp olive oil 1 sprig rosemary 1-2 lamb chops or steaks per person depending on size & appetite 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220Â°C/Gas 7. Toss the onions in 3 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Now spread over a roasting tray and add the rosemary, torn and sprinkled over the onion. Transfer to the hot oven for 5-10 minutes. During this time, brush the chops with the remaining olive oil, season and brown over a high heat for 3 minutes on each side. Remove the onion from the oven, turn together with the balsamic vinegar, and top with the lamb chops. Return everything to the oven for a further 5-12 minutes depending on how you like your lamb cooked. Sprinkle with parsley before serving.
