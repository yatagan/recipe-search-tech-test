Slow cooked onions with rosemary and cream
Introduction:
This is a lesson in the transformative power of time and heat. It makes a great base for a French onion soup or onion gravy; just add a few ladles of good stock in place of the cream and herbs.
Ingredients:
4 large white onions, finely sliced butter 1 small glass of white wine or sherry 100ml double cream leaves from a stalk of rosemary, finely chopped.
Method:
Put the onions in a saucepan with oil and a walnut sized knob of butter. Cook gently for 20 minutes, you want the onions to cook but not colour or stick. If this looks likely add a small dash of water as you go. After the onions have softened you can let then take on a little bit of colour, scrapping the bottom of the pan and giving regular turns for another 20 minutes. Add the booze, allow to bubble away until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season well with salt. You should have a golden, buttery tangle. Add the cream and herbs and putter on for another 10 minutes to slightly reduce the mixture.
