Mushroom risotto
Introduction:
The doubling of mushrooms with porcini adds depth to this rich, autumnal risotto. Use pecorino or another hard cheese in place of Parmesan if you are vegetarian. Marsala or Madeira cooks down beautiful to lend a slight sweet edge, but skip it if you don't have any, or use white wine for a different effect. 
Ingredients:
30g dried porcini mushrooms, soaked in 300ml boiling water for 30 mins 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme 400g risotto rice 100ml Madeira or masala (optional) 200g mushrooms, sliced 1.2 litres hot veg stock 25g butter 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and thyme for a few minutes to soften. Pour in the rice and stir continuously for 2 minutes. Add the Madeira or masala if using and stir for a minute. Add all the mushrooms and the porcini liquid. Cook for 1 minute. Add hot stock a ladle at a time, stirring occasionally, letting the rice absorb it before adding more. It will take about 20 minutes before the rice is tender but still has a little bite â€“ taste a grain or two. Season, then stir in the butter and Parmesan, until it goes creamy. Top with some Parmesan shavings if you like.
