Potato and horseradish latkes (potato pancakes)
Introduction:
Don’t be concerned by the amount of fresh horseradish in these golden, fried latkes – it loses some of its potency during cooking. If you like you could also leave it out and serve these with horseradish sauce on top instead. They're a traditional favorite for Hanukkah, but also pretty good for an extended brunch, starter topped with smoked salmon, or dinner paired with warm beetroot salad. 
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, peeled & grated 2 medium onions, rated 4 tbsp horseradish root, finely shredded 3 large eggs, beaten 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 scant tsp salt 2 tbsp sunflower oil
Method:
Place the grated potatoes and onions in a colander and squeeze out as much water as possible. Place in a large mixing bowl and combine with the horseradish. Stir in the eggs, garlic, and salt. Using a sixth of the mixture for each latke, press the mixture into patties about the size of the palm of your hand, squeezing out any excess liquid. Heat the oil in a large pan. Using a spatula, carefully slide as many patties as will fit into the pan. Cook over a medium heat for about 3 minutes per side or until the latkes are golden brown. Repeat until they’re all done, adding additional oil as needed. Place on a sheet of kitchen paper and keep warm.
