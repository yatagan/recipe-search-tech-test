Celery in sweet and sour tomato sauce
Introduction:
This recipe is a little bit fiddly but very much worth it for the rich, subtle sauce it makes. This should be eaten at room temperature to fully appreciate the range of flavours. It's a lovely accompaniment to lamb, but would also be good as a pasta sauce. It'll keep well in the fridge for a couple of days. 
Ingredients:
450g celery stalks 5 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped 400g tin chopped tomatoes, or 450g tomatoes, skinned & chopped 3 tbsp sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar 2 tbsp caster sugar 4 cloves 1 cinnamon stick ½ star anise, broken into 'petals' (optional) 14 black olives, pitted & sliced 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Split the wider lower ends of the celery stalks in 2, then slice the whole lot thinly. Use either 2 frying pans to cook the celery, or cook in 2 batches. In each pan, heat 2½ tablespoons of oil and add half of the celery. Sauté over a brisk heat until browned - this takes quite some time as there's a good deal of water in celery to be evaporated off. Scoop out the celery. Sauté the onion in the same oil in one of the pans, adding a little extra oil if necessary until lightly browned. Add the tomatoes. Cook over a high heat for a few minutes until thick, then add the vinegar, sugar, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, if using, and a little salt and pepper. Return the celery to the pan. Simmer gently for a further 10 minutes. Stir in the olives and parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning, then spoon into a serving dish and leave to cool.
