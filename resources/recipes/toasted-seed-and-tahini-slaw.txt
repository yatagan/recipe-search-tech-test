Toasted seed and tahini slaw
Introduction:
Mixed toasted seeds add extra crunch, flavour and nutrients to coleslaw. You needn’t stick to cabbage and carrots – try grating any other root veg you have in your box. This one’s good served with chicken wings and potato wedges.
Ingredients:
4 tbsp mixed seeds (eg. sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, linseed) 4 tbsp plain yoghurt 1 garlic clove, crushed or grated 1 tbsp light tahini (sesame) paste juice of 1 lemon ½ Savoy cabbage, core & tough ribs removed, leaves very finely shredded 2 carrots, peeled & coarsely grated 1 small or ½ large onion (red or white), very finely sliced salt & pepper
Method:
Toast the mixed seeds in a dry frying pan for 1–2 minutes over a medium heat, until fragrant. Mix the yoghurt, garlic, tahini and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, onion and toasted seeds, season and toss gently to combine. Season to taste and add a good swirl of cream or crème fraîche if you fancy.
