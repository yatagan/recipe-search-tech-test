Kohlrabi salad with herb dressing
Introduction:
Crisp raw kohlrabi is set off well here by tangy yoghurt, fresh herbs and chilli. You could also add in some apple, fennel or cabbage. This coleslaw-style salad holds its crunch well, making it a good one for packed lunches, picnics and barbecues. 
Ingredients:
1 kohlrabi, peeled - about 250-275g peeled weight 1 green chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 6 tbsp plain yoghurt ½ red onion, finely sliced 2 tbsp fresh coriander leaves, chopped 4 fresh mint leaves, finely shredded 1 tsp white wine vinegar pinch of sea salt ½ tsp sugar 1 tsp paprika
Method:
Cut the kohlrabi in half, place the cut sides flat on the work surface and slice thinly, then cut into matchstick-sized strips. To make the dressing, combine all the other ingredients except the paprika in a large bowl. Add the kohlrabi and stir to coat with the dressing. Serve sprinkled with the paprika.
