Spinach & ricotta gnocchi 
Introduction:
Gnocchi made with ricotta, flour, egg & spinach is known as ‘malfatti’ - which broadly translates as ‘badly formed’! You want the gnocchi dough to be quite firm, so add just half the egg to begin with. It is shaped, using 2 spoons, into walnut-size ovals; you want to aim for about 10 gnocchi.
Ingredients:
200g spinach 1 egg 125g ricotta 20g plain flour ¼ tsp nutmeg 40g Italian-style hard cheese 50g polenta 50g whole toasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped 1 bunch radish, thinly sliced 1 large or 2 small carrots, peeled into ribbons 50g mixed salad leaves 25g butter ½ tbsp balsamic vinegar
Method:
Gently wilt the spinach for approx. 2-3 mins. Drain. Squeeze out excess water. Roughly chop. In a mug, crack & break up the egg with a fork. Weigh out 30g of the egg into another mug. In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, flour & nutmeg - it will look like lumpy breadcrumbs. Stir in the spinach, Italian-style cheese & the egg. Season. Mix it well with your hands, so the spinach & ricotta is evenly distributed. Scatter a thin layer of the polenta onto a tray (keep some back). Using approx. 1 tbsp of the ricotta mix at a time, use 2 spoons (or hands) to shape it into ovals. Place them on the tray & sprinkle over the remaining polenta. Gently shake the tray to coat them. Put in the fridge for 20 mins to firm up. Meanwhile, refill the large pan with salted water & bring to a low boil. Put the salad leaves in another bowl, with the radishes, carrots and ½ the nuts. Using a slotted spoon, lower the gnocchi into the pan of barely bubbling water. Boil for 1-2 mins, until they float to the surface. Scoop out onto a plate. Roll them gently over a piece of kitchen paper to dry. Melt the butter in a large frying pan. When it starts to foam, fry the gnocchi for 2-3 mins on each side until golden. Add the remaining nuts when you turn the gnocchi over. Toss the salad with a little olive oil & a splash of vinegar to taste. Serve with the gnocchi.
