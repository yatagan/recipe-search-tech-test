Teriyaki sprouts with chilli and sesame
Introduction:
Guy’s brother Ben runs the farm shop and kitchen where we make the teriyaki sauce sold alongside our vegboxes. It’s great for quick meat stir-fries, but is also good with green veg. Serve with cooked rice or egg noodles tossed in a little sesame oil for a simple vegetarian supper (add some tofu for protein), or add leftover pieces of cooked chicken, beef or pork from a roast. 
Ingredients:
500g Brussels sprouts, trimmed oil for frying to a high temp, e.g. sunflower 1-2 red chillies, thinly sliced, seeds removed for less heat, if you prefer 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 3cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated or cut into very thin matchsticks 2 tbsp teriyaki sauce 1 tbsp sesame seeds (we used black ones for colour, but normal ones will do)
Method:
Boil the sprouts in a pan of salted water for about 5 minutes, depending on size, until just tender. Drain, refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. Leave whole, or cut larger ones in half. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in wok or large frying pan. When hot, add the sprouts, chilli, garlic and ginger. Stir fry for 2 minutes, then add the teriyaki sauce and sesame seeds and toss together for a few moments before serving.
