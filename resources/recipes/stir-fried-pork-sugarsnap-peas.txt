Stir-fried pork with sugar snap peas
Introduction:
This super-quick dish has a lovely, bold range of Thai flavours. It goes well with brown rice noodles, or with rice. You could also add in chopped asparagus, or use chicken or tofu instead of the pork. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp vegetable oil 400g pork mince 2 tbsp lemongrass paste 1 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp fish sauce 2 red chillies, deseeded & finely sliced 2 handfuls sugar snap peas bunch fresh mint
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan until hot. Stir-fry the pork until just cooked (about 4 minutes). Add the lemongrass paste and stir for a minute. Next add the sugar (use palm sugar if you can), and cook for another minute. Add the fish sauce and cook for another minute, then taste. Add more palm sugar or fish sauce to taste. Add the chillies, peas, mint and a spoonful of water, and stir fry for another couple of minutes. Serve immediately.
