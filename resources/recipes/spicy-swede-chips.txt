Spicy swede chips
Introduction:
The mild nuttiness of swede is a excellent setting for a bit of spice. Eat these golden chips with a simple roast chicken and some braised or steamed green veg. Or just serve them as a starter with a pot of mayonnaise for dipping. 
Ingredients:
1 swede, about 600-700g, peeled 2 tbsp melted butter 2 tbsp olive oil ½ tsp hot chilli powder 1 tsp garam masala salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the swede in half, then into 1cm slices, then into chip-style lengths. Put in a baking dish and toss with the rest of the ingredients to evenly coat. Roast in the oven at for 40-45 minutes, until the swede is cooked through and turning golden brown.
