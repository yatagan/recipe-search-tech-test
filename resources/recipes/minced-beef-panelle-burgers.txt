Minced beef panelle burgers
Introduction:
Panelle are Italian chickpea fritters, a popular snack served hot and crispy straight out of the pan. Here the addition of minced beef turns them into more of a main meal – they're great eaten in a sesame bun, either on their own of with all the trappings you'd usually have with a burger. Or try them with braised greens and quinoa for a lighter dinner. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 350g minced beef 1 mug chickpea flour 2 mugs water
Method:
Sauté the onion until soft. Add the garlic and minced beef and continue to cook for 5 minutes. Pour off any fat and tip the mixture onto some kitchen paper. Pat with more kitchen paper to dry. Make a paste by mixing the chickpea flour and water, and stir in the beef and onion mixture. Tip onto an oiled baking tray, cool and cut into squares. Fry in about 2cm of oil heated to 180°C (watch them like a hawk) until golden and crispy. In Sicily they serve them in sesame rolls.
