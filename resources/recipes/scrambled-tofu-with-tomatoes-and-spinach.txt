Scrambled tofu on toast with tomatoes & spinach 
Introduction:
Unlike scrambled eggs, where low and slow is best, you want to cook your tofu on a galloping heat. It tastes all the better if it gets a little colour in the pan. Far from being strong and pungent, black garlic has a deep, savoury taste. If you want to mimic real scrambled egg, you can also use black salt; it isn’t always easy to find, but has a sulphurous, eggy taste to it. 
Ingredients:
400g tomatoes ½ tbsp smoked paprika salt & pepper olive oil 2 black garlic cloves (or use 1 normal clove) 300g natural tofu ½ tsp turmeric ½ tsp cumin 2 slices sourdough bread 150g baby spinach, freshly washed 1 lemon
Method:
Preheat your oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Halve the tomatoes and place them in a roasting tray, cut side up. Sprinkle with paprika, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with oil. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 mins, or until cooked through and starting to colour. Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the garlic. Place the tofu in a bowl and break it into coarse chunks with a fork. Stir in the garlic, turmeric, cumin and a good pinch of salt. When the tomatoes are ready, put your bread on to toast or griddle. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a frying pan or wok and add the tofu. Cook on a high heat for 2-3 mins until hot, adding a dash of water if it looks like catching in the pan. Drag your toast through the roasting tray to soak up any oil and roasting juices from the tomatoes. Place them on plates and pile the tofu and tomatoes on top. Put the pan you cooked the tofu in back on the heat and throw in the spinach. Let it cook down until just wilted; this will take less than a minute. Finish with a pinch of salt and squeeze of lemon to taste. Serve it alongside the tofu.
