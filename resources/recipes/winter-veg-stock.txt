Winter veg stock
Introduction:
For soups, vegetable stews and risottos. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 large onions, roughly chopped 1 large leek, roughly chopped 2 large carrots, roughly chopped 3 sticks celery, chopped a bouquet garni: 3 bay leaves, a bunch of parsley stalks & a few thyme stalks, tied together tightly with string (white string, not Bridget Jones blue!) 10 whole black peppercorns
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan or stock pot. Add the veg and cook on a very low heat, stirring now and then for 20-30 minutes, until the veg has a caramelised colour. Add the bouquet garni, peppercorns and 2 litres cold water. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, partially covered with a lid, for 1 hour, skimming off any scum from time to time. Strain. Leave to cool, skim again, then chill or freeze in batches. You could boil it down for a stronger flavour.
