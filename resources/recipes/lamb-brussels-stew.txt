Lamb and Brussels sprout stew
Introduction:
This stew is nourishing, tasty and economical - very good for a cool autumn evening. Replace the sprouts with Savoy cabbage or kale if that's what you have in your veg box. If you have time, make this a few hours or even a day in advance and then re-heat it â€“ it really brings together the flavours. Eat on its own, or with a loaf of crusty white bread. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1kg lamb, diced 1 large onion, chopped 4 carrots, roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped (optional) 1.2 litres stock few sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary, or 1-2 tsp dried 200g pearl barley 4 potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped 200g Brussels sprouts, halved, cores intact bunch fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil and fry the lamb until browned (do this in batches if needs be, depending on your pan size). Remove the lamb from the pan, add another tablespoon of oil and add the onion, carrots and garlic. Cook gently until softened. Add the browned lamb, stock, thyme and pearl barley to the pan. Heat to boiling point, reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour. Skim any fat off the top every now and again. Add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes. Add the Brussels sprouts and simmer for 5 minutes or so until tender. Season, and serve with fresh parsley.
