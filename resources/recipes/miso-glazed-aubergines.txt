miso-glazed aubergines
Introduction:
Miso is a salty fermented paste made from soy beans and wheat or rice, with a unique and slightly addictive flavour, although as with Marmite; you love or hate its saltiness. Miso can be used as a marinade, or added to liquid to make a broth. It is readily available in large supermarkets and Asian grocers and there are different types – white miso being the sweetest. The paste often comes in packets or pots, ; it keeps for a while but if you find it coming to the end of its fridge shelf life before you’ve used it all, freeze in ice cubes trays or small tubs. Serve this with sticky rice, a simple salad or coleslaw with an Asian dressing, or with wilted pak choi or summer greens. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp miso (brown or white) 4 tbsp mirin 2 aubergines, split and roasted in halves 1 tbsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted
Method:
Preheat your oven to 200˚C/gas 6. Cut the aubergines in half, lengthways. Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern. Drizzle generously with oil and season with salt. Roast flesh side up for about 30-40 minutes until soft to the core and nicely coloured. Mix the miso, mirin and 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl or mug. Put the roasted aubergine halves flesh side up on a baking sheet and smear with the miso mixture. Grill under a medium grill until the miso is golden. Scatter with the toasted sesame seeds.
