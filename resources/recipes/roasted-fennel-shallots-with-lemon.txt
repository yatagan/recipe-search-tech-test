Roasted fennel and shallots with lemon and olives
Introduction:
Caramelised shallots and fennel make a soft and flavoursome combination in this quick, oven-baked vegan dish, whilst the olives and lemon add a salty-sharp finish. This is good with baked eggs, roasted chicken, pork or fish. 
Ingredients:
2 large or 3 smaller fennel bulbs, trimmed (save the feathery fronds for garnish) 8 shallots, peeled & cut in half if large 12 pitted olives (green or black) oil for roasting 2 lemons - 1 juiced, 1 cut into thick slices
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Cut each fennel bulb into 6 wedges. Boil in salted water for 5 minutes. Transfer to a roasting tin with the shallots, olives and sliced lemon. Toss in just enough oil to coat. Season and squeeze over the juice from the other lemon. Roast for about 45 minutes until slighty sticky and lightly caramelised. Use the fronds to garnish.
