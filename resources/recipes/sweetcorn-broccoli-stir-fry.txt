Sweetcorn and broccoli stir-fry
Introduction:
A quick, healthy and vibrant vegetarian side. Add strips of tofu or chicken (for the non-vegetarians) to make it a main. Slices of bell pepper and mushroom are also good additions. This recipe works with both calabrese (in season from August to late October) and purple sprouting broccoli (from January to May). 
Ingredients:
2 sweetcorn cobs, husks removed 2 tbsp oil for stir-frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 2 spring onions, green & white parts, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 small-medium heads broccoli florets, cut into the same sized pieces 2 tsp soy sauce few drops sesame oil salt & pepper
Method:
Remove corn kernels by standing the cob on end and holding it firmly, then use a sharp knife to slice away the kernels, cutting in as close to the cob as you can. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok until very hot. Drop in the ginger and spring onion, stir briefly, add the garlic and chilli, stir again, and then add the broccoli florets. Stir fry the broccoli for a couple of minutes until tender, then add the corn kernels. Fry for a minute or two more then add salt, pepper, sesame oil and soy. Serve with rice or noodles with the coriander leaves as garnish.
