Spring greens risotto
Introduction:
This is a fresh, inexpensive springtime risotto, good enough eaten alone, or as a side to a dinner of roast chicken. Spring greens are at their best within four days of arriving in your veg box. This is a versatile recipe: add a spoonful of pesto, some chopped asparagus or purple sprouting broccoli, or, if you can find some, wild garlic, all stirred in about 10 minutes after you start adding the liquid. 
Ingredients:
bunch spring greens, tough stems removed, leaves shredded into 1cm ribbons 1 tbsp olive oil 30g butter 1 onion, finely diced Â½ red chilli, finely sliced 600-700ml chicken or veg stock 200g risotto rice 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1 glass dry sherry or vermouth or white wine 50g Parmesan, grated, & extra to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch spring greens in salted boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain. Heat the oil and butter together in a solid saucepan. Gently sweat the onion and chilli for 5-10 minutes, without colouring. In another saucepan, heat up the stock until simmering. Add the rice, garlic, greens and some seasoning to the onion. Stir to coat with the butter and oil. Turn up the heat a little, add the wine, and cook until most of it has evaporated. Add a ladleful of the hot stock to the rice. Stir until most of the liquid has been absorbed, then add another ladleful. Repeat for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is just cooked (it should retain a little bit of bite). Season, then take off the heat and add the Parmesan and a little more butter. Serve with some extra Parmesan.
