Turkish candied squash
Introduction:
This is one of the best squash desserts that we've come across, but it is very sweet indeed, so serve in small portions. A fairly dense fleshed squash such as butternut is easiest to handle. Pumpkin works as an alternative, but has more of a tendency to collapse so can make the pudding look a little mushier. 
Ingredients:
1kg wedge winter squash, rind trimmed and flesh cut into 2.5cm chunks 225g caster sugar 120ml water crème fraîche, whipped cream or Greek yoghurt 100g walnuts, roughly chopped
Method:
Layer chunks of squash with the sugar in a wide saucepan and pour over the water. Cover tightly, and cook over a very low heat for about 1 hour, turning the pumpkin carefully occasionally. Towards the end of the cooking time have a look in the pan to assess the liquid level. If it is copious, uncover and let the liquid boil down to a thick syrup. Cool in the pan. Spoon into individual dishes and chill. To serve, top with a dollop of crème fraîche, cream or yoghurt, then scatter with walnuts.
