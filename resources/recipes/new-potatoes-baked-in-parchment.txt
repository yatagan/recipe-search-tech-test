New potatoes baked in parchment
Introduction:
'En papilotte' is the French for food baked in parchment. This nifty technique seals in the herb flavours and lets the food cook in its own moisture. These new potatoes are a good accompaniment to a dinner of white fish or salmon. 
Ingredients:
6 or 7 small new potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled (if the potatoes are large, cut them in ½) 3 garlic cloves, crushed (wet garlic can also be used) leaves from a sprig of rosemary or a few sprigs of thyme or summer savory, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Place the potatoes in a bowl with the garlic, herbs and olive oil. Season well and toss so they are coated in the oil and seasonings. Cut a square of baking parchment large enough to hold the potatoes comfortably and fold it in half to make a crease. Unfold it and lay the potatoes on the lower half. Bring the rest of the paper over the potatoes and roll it up lightly along the edges to form a pouch (a bit like making a pasty). Make sure that the package is well sealed. You can staple it, if you like. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes and then serve immediately. The packages will puff up. Put them on serving plates so everyone can open theirs at the table.
