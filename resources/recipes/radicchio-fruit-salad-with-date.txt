Radicchio and fruit salad with date and allspice dressing
Introduction:
Deep burgundy, bitter radicchio pairs fabulously with sweet, ripe fruit in this elegant winter salad. Persimmons or good, firm pears work very well, or try sliced oranges for juiciness, or pomegranate seeds for jewel-like beauty. You could use pecans as well or instead of walnuts, and crumble over a little creamy blue cheese if you want to add salty tones to the mix. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp date syrup or honey zest & juice of ½ an orange 1 tsp Dijon mustard ½ tsp ground allspice, from fresh ground berries (or ¾ tsp pre-ground) 4 tbsp olive oil 1 good-sized radicchio, finely sliced, tough core removed 2 persimmons or pears, sliced into thin wedges 75g walnut pieces, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan 8 dates, pitted & finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the date syrup, orange zest and juice, mustard, allspice and olive oil in a large bowl. Whisk together. Season. Add the radicchio, persimmons or pears, walnuts and dates and toss together gently to combine. Serve straight away.
