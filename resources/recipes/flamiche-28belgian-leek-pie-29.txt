Flamiche (Belgian leek pie)
Introduction:
Somewhere between a quiche and a pie, this has a thin pastry base, a rich leek and cream filling, and a golden, crisp pastry topping. Serve warm with a crisp green salad for a light lunch or dinner. Use Pecorino rather than Parmesan for vegetarians. If you don't have quite enough leeks in your box, use some other greens or onions to bulk it up. 
Ingredients:
800g leeks, trimmed & sliced 60g butter 6 tbsp double cream or crème frâiche a little nutmeg, grated 60g Parmesan cheese, grated (or use a vegetarian alternative) 1 tbsp tarragon leaves, chopped 500g all-butter puff pastry (or use shortcrust) 1 egg yolk, beaten salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. In a large pan, gently cook the leeks in the butter until soft. Transfer to a large bowl and allow to cool. Add the cream, nutmeg, Parmesan and tarragon, if using, then season well. While the leeks are cooking, butter a flan case. Halve the pastry and roll it into two balls, then roll out one half into a large circle and use to line the flan case. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Roll out the other pastry half into a similar sized circle, and keep covered until ready to use. Spread the leek mixture over the pastry base, then brush some egg yolk over the exposed edges of the pastry. Place the reserved pastry circle over the top of the pie and pinch the edges together to seal. Brush the top with remaining egg yolk and make some slits in the lid to allow steam to escape. Decorate the pie top with a light criss-cross pattern using a knife and bake for 30-40 minutes, until the pastry is golden. A preheated baking sheet under the pie will help crisp up the base.
