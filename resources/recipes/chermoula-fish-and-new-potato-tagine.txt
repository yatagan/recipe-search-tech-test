Chermoula fish and new potato tagine
Introduction:
This fish dish is both comforting on a cold winter’s night and light enough for the summer. Chermoula is a North African marinade made of a mixture of herbs, oil, lemon juice, preserved lemons, garlic, cumin, and salt. If you don't have a preserved lemon, serve the finished dish with wedges of fresh lemon to squeeze over the top instead. 
Ingredients:
600g sustainably caught pollack fillet, pinboned (larger middle bones removed) & cut into 8 pieces 600g new potatoes, halved or quartered if large 250g cherry tomatoes, 125g halved, the rest left whole 20 pitted black olives ½ a preserved lemon, flesh removed, peel rinsed & finely chopped 100ml hot veg stock for the chermoula: 2 garlic cloves 1 tsp coarse salt 2 tsp cumin seeds, crushed or ground 1-2 red chillies, deseeded & chopped juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp olive oil small bunch of coriander, chopped
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Make the chermoula: pound the garlic and salt in a pestle and mortar. Stir in the cumin, chilli, lemon, oil and coriander. Or you can blitz everything in a processor. Toss the fish with half the mixture and leave in the fridge. Mix the potatoes, tomatoes, olives and preserved lemon in an ovenproof tagine or lidded casserole. Add the stock. Season, cover and cook in the oven for 40 minutes. Add the fish and cook for another 15 minutes. Drizzle over the rest of the chermoula to serve.
