Lebanese pizza with hummus
Introduction:
A very quick and simple dinner; just spread the topping over flatbreads and bake. The better the quality of your lamb, the better the dish will be. These pizzas are good with a crisp green salad. You could also make your own hummus – which hardly takes any time. 
Ingredients:
handful pinenuts 2 onions, diced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 400g lamb mince olive oil pinch cumin pinch cinnamon 4 flatbreads 8 tbsp hummus lemon handful fresh parsley, finely chopped pinch paprika salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ºC/Gas 6. Dry roast the pinenuts, or fry in a pan without oil until golden. In another frying pan fry the onion and garlic for a few minutes, until softened but not brown. Add the mince and spices, breaking it up with a spoon, and fry until there is no pink left - this should take about 10 minutes. Put 2 baking trays in the oven. Taste the mince and season, then spread first the hummus and then the mince over the flatbreads. Scatter on the pinenuts and press in the topping with a rolling pin. Put the flatbreads onto the hot baking trays and cook for about 7 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon, a sprinkling of parsley and paprika and eat immediately.
