Gazpacho
Introduction:
This classic soup is easy to make and full of light, summery flavour. To get the best taste you'll need very ripe, juicy tomatoes and lots of good olive oil. To make this a full meal, eat with a crusty white bread, ham and hard boiled eggs. Make sure you leave plenty of time to chill the soup. 
Ingredients:
480g tomatoes, roughly chopped Â½ cucumber, peeled & roughly chopped 1 red pepper, deseeded & roughly chopped 2 small or 1 large salad onion, roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 4 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling 200ml cold water or cold veg stock 2 tbsp sherry vinegar 2 tbsp dry sherry (optional) 1 red chilli, deseeded & roughly chopped a pinch of paprika (use smoked if you like it) large handful fresh basil or coriander, shredded
Method:
Place all the ingredients except the paprika and basil in a food processor and blitz for several minutes until the soup is fairly smooth. Transfer to a bowl and chill for an hour or two (or overnight). Serve the soup with a few ice cubes in the bowl if you have any. Sprinkle with paprika and shredded basil leaves, with an extra drizzle of olive oil.
