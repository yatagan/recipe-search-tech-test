Pasta Alla Norma
Introduction:
A classic Sicilian recipe is supposedly named after 'Norma', an opera by Bellini. This is healthy, vegetarian and – apart from salting the aubergines – very quick to make. 
Ingredients:
1 large aubergine 2-3 garlic cloves, finely chopped olive oil for frying 750g ripe tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & chopped 400g spaghetti 3 tbsp Pecorino or Parmesan, grated, to serve small handful fresh basil, torn salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the aubergine into 1cm discs and cut into 1cm wide strips. Spread out in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Leave to drain for an hour, then rinse and pat dry. Fry the garlic gently in 4 tablespoons olive oil until beginning to colour. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper and simmer for 15 minutes or so to make a thick tomato sauce. Re-heat when needed. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the spaghetti. Boil until al dente. While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a generous layer of olive oil in a wide frying-pan, and fry the aubergine until browned, in 2 batches if necessary. Drain on kitchen paper. Drain the spaghetti and tip into a large serving bowl. Add the hot tomato sauce, cheese, and the basil. Toss quickly. Top with the fried aubergine and serve with extra cheese to hand round.
