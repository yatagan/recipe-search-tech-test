North African spiced beef and root vegetable stew
Introduction:
Ras el hanout is a complex North African spice mix. If you can’t get hold of it, mix a large pinch each of cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, cardamom, chilli or cayenne and black pepper. Cinnamon sticks can vary in strength, so taste at intervals and remove when the flavour reaches your liking. Serve this stew with couscous or bread to soak up the juices.
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive, sunflower or vegetable oil 450g beef braising steak, cut into 4 similar-sized pieces 1 large onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated (or 1 rounded tsp dried ginger) 1 rounded tbsp ras el hanout 800g mixed root veg (e.g. parsnips, carrots, celeriac, swede), peeled & chopped into large chunks 200ml red wine (optional; you can use more stock instead) 400ml beef stock 1 cinnamon stick 400g tin chickpeas, drained 100g pitted prunes handful fresh parsley or coriander, chopped seeds from 1 pomegranate (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a heavy-based pot or casserole and fry the beef over a medium–high heat, turning it over so it browns on both sides. Remove to a plate. Add the remaining oil to the pot, turn the heat right down and add the onion. Fry gently, stirring often, for 10 minutes to soften without colouring. Add the garlic, ginger and ras el hanout and cook, stirring, for a couple more minutes. Return the beef and add the vegetables and wine (if using). Bring to a simmer and bubble for a couple of minutes. Then add the stock and cinnamon stick, cover and simmer gently for 1 hour. Stir in the chickpeas and prunes, re-cover the pot and simmer for a further 15 minutes, until the meat is totally tender. Sprinkle over the herbs and pomegranate seeds if using.
