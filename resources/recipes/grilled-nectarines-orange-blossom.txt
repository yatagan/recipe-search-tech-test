Grilled nectarines with orange blossom, ginger yogurt & almonds 
Introduction:
These griddled nectarines are simplicity itself. You can substitute nectarines with peaches if you like. If you can’t get any ginger yogurt, you can make your own by chopping some sweet stem ginger into thick Greek-style yogurt. 
Ingredients:
1 lemon 100g unrefined caster sugar 70ml cold water 2 tsp orange blossom water, or to taste 4 nectarines vegetable or sunflower oil 300g ginger yoghurt 60g flaked & toasted almonds
Method:
Use a peeler to pull 2 thin strips of zest from the lemon. Place them in a small saucepan with the sugar and the water. Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Slowly bring to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve the sugar. Simmer for 1 minute, turn off the heat and leave to cool. When it has cooled, add the orange blossom water; start with 1 teaspoon and add the rest to your taste. You can make this well in advance. Halve and stone the nectarines and lightly brush with some plain oil. Place them on the BBQ and griddle them, face-side down, over a medium heat until nicely marked. This should take about 3-4 minutes; resist the temptation to play with them too much or they’ll tend to stick or tear. Flip them and cook for a further 3-4 minutes or so until softened – the skins will wrinkle and pull away from the flesh when they are ready. Divide the warm nectarines between 4 bowls. Spoon over a little of the syrup. Top with a blob of yogurt and a scattering of almonds.
