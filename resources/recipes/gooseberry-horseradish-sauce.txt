Gooseberry and horseradish sauce
Introduction:
Try this for a seasonal twist on the usual apple sauce with your pork roast. The addition of a dollop of creamed horseradish gives the gooseberries a real kick. This is also very good with smoked mackerel, cutting through its oiliness, and with smoky barbecued pork. 
Ingredients:
300g gooseberries 30g caster sugar 3 tsp creamed horseradish salt & pepper
Method:
Combine all of the ingredients together in a pan and cook gently until the gooseberries break down. Serve chunky, or pass through a sieve if preferred.
