Roasted asparagus with smoked salmon and lemon dressing
Introduction:
This fresh starter sings of spring. Roasting intensifies the taste of asparagus and a little lemon cuts through the oiliness of smoked salmon. You could add a poached egg for a luxuriant breakfast, or a handful of young, briefly blanched broad beans. It would also be delicious chopped up and mixed with a little crème fraîche for a luxurious pasta sauce. 
Ingredients:
24-30 asparagus spears, depending on size, trimmed olive oil juice of ½-1 lemon, to taste small handful fresh chives, chopped 6 smoked salmon slices salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Place the asparagus spears on a baking tray and toss with just enough olive oil to coat. Season. Roast for about 10-12 minutes until they are just lightly browned and tender. If the spears are small they will take less time to cook, so keep an eye on them. For the lemon and chive dressing, mix the juice of ½ a lemon in a bowl with 4 tablespoons of olive oil and chives and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste, adding a little more lemon juice if needed. To serve, divide the asparagus spears between six plates. Serve drizzled with the dressing, with a slice of smoked salmon.
