Potato frittata and tomato salsa
Introduction:
This versatile vegetarian frittata is good warm, cold or at room temperature. It makes a superb picnic or packed lunch, or can be cut into cubes to be offered as a tapas with drinks. For a greener meal, try substituting 100g of potatoes with spinach or cooked leeks. 
Ingredients:
for the salsa: 300-400g tomatoes zest & juice of 1-2 limes 1 onion, preferably red 1 green chilli, finely chopped (remove the seeds if you don't like it too spicy) for the frittata: 2 large onions, finely sliced 700g new potatoes, cooked & diced 2 tbsp olive oil 6 large eggs, beaten 100g Parmesan, grated (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
First make the salsa: Cut tomatoes into quarters and remove seeds. Cut the flesh into small dices and combine with other ingredients. Season to taste and set aside. Make the frittata: Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Cook onions slowly in the oil for about 20 minutes until soft, stirring occasionally. Turn the heat up to medium, add the potatoes and fry for a few minutes. Pour over the beaten eggs and season well (grated Parmesan can be added here). Continue cooking until the underside of the omelette has turned golden. Place the pan in heated oven. Close oven door if possible and leave for 5 minutes. Check that the omelette is cooked by inserting a knife. If still very liquid, give the omelette a few more minutes - the omelette should be firm but slightly runny on the inside.
