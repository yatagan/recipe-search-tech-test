Roasted Savoy with mulled cider
Introduction:
People rarely think to roast a cabbage, but with a little care it will make you look at a whole head of cabbage without a sense of trepidation. The edges should be lightly crisp and burnt but the middle soft and tender. The cider adds flavour but also stops the cabbage burning too much in the dry heat of the oven. Some crispy bacon, and a swirl of mustard, cream and parsley would make this truly indulgent. 
Ingredients:
1 Savoy or other tightly packed cabbage, e.g. January King 200ml mulled or plain cider
Method:
Preheat oven to 220ËšC/Gas 7. Remove any large loose outer leaves and cut the cabbage into 8 equal wedges. Brush each wedge generously with light olive oil and season well. Lay the wedges in a roasting tray and bake for 20 minutes, turning once to colour evenly. Add the cider to the roasting tray and bake for another 10-15 minutes, turning once, until tender. Serve with the remaining cider juices tipped over the top.
