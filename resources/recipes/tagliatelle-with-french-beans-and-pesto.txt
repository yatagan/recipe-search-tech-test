Tagliatelle with French beans and pesto
Introduction:
This quick and surprising combination (pasta Genovese) works wonderfully – the potatoes soak up the pesto, the pasta gives substance and the beans verdancy. Try to make pesto rather using it out of a jar – it really brings this dish together. You could add courgettes and broccoli to the pasta too for a more substantial dinner. 
Ingredients:
large bunch fresh basil 1 garlic clove, crushed 3 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan 100–150ml olive oil 80g Parmesan cheese, freshly grated 500g tagliatelle 300g waxy potatoes, thinly sliced 200g French beans, topped & tailed salt & pepper
Method:
Put the basil, garlic, pine nuts and a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar and grind to a paste (or process them in a food processor). Transfer to a bowl and stir in enough olive oil to give the consistency you like. Add the Parmesan cheese and adjust the seasoning. Cook the tagliatelle in boiling salted water with the potatoes, adding the French beans for the last 5 minutes of cooking. Drain, return to the pan, season, and toss with pesto. You could add grated Parmesan and a little cream, if you like.
