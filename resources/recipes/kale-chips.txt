Kale chips
Introduction:
Oven-baked kale chips are a super-easy, crisp and salty snack or side – and chockful of vitamin A, C and calcium. These are very adaptable: toss with paprika, cayenne, lemon zest, Parmesan, red wine vinegar etc before baking – though perhaps not all at the same time! 
Ingredients:
small bunch curly kale leaves, washed & thoroughly dried, stripped from stalks & torn into pieces olive oil fine sea salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Lay a sheet of greaseproof paper on a non-stick baking tray. Toss the kale leaves in just a little oil, barely enough to coat. Lay the leaves on the tray in a single layer and gently press them as flat as you can on the baking tray, so they crisp up. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake for 6-10 minutes, depending on your oven, until they are crispy and just starting to turn brown at the edges. You’ll need to keep a good eye on them. Remove and eat immediately; they will keep for a little while in an airtight tub but will start to lose their crispness very quickly, so are best eaten straightaway.
