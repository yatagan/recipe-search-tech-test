Mushroom pâté
Introduction:
This lovely aromatic pâté is delicious spread on buttery toast as a starter, perhaps with a garnish of parsley and chopped gherkins. Or try it for a dinner main with lots of Pecorino, stirred through a bowl of warm pasta; or used to top our spinach baked potatoes. 
Ingredients:
30g butter ½ large onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 200g mushrooms, cleaned & chopped 1 tbsp fresh thyme, chopped 75g flaked almonds, toasted 1 ½-2 tbsp soured cream 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a small frying pan, melt the butter. Add the onions and fry on a gentle heat for 7-8 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme and cook for a few minutes more, until the mushrooms are softened and the liquid has evaporated. Leave to cool. Blitz the toasted almonds in a food processor. Add the mushroom mixture and blitz again until almost smooth. Gradually add the soured cream and blitz until the mixture is of a spreadable but not too runny consistency. Stir in the parsley to finish and season to taste.
