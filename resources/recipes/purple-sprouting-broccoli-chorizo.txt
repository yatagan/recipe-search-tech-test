Purple sprouting broccoli with chorizo and potatoes
Introduction:
Wedges of crisp potato fried with smoky chorizo and tossed with tender purple sprouting broccoli. Simple and full-flavoured, this recipe relies on the great taste of our cooking chorizo. Eat it as a side for simply cooked chicken or fish, or increase the quantities slightly for a main course. 
Ingredients:
300g potatoes, left whole in their skins 200g purple sprouting broccoli 100g cooking chorizo oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or olive lemon wedge a little fresh parsley, chopped, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, 20 minutes or so, depending on size, then chop into wedges. Boil or steam the purple sprouting broccoli for 4 minutes, until just tender. Drain and refresh in very cold water, then drain again. Peel the skin off the chorizo. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan, crumble in the chorizo, add the potato and fry for a few minutes to cook the chorizo through and crisp the potato. Add the broccoli and fry for a minute to warm through. Season with salt and pepper. Serve with a squeeze of lemon and a sprinkling of parsley if you like.
