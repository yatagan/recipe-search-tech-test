Warm beetroot and coconut relish
Introduction:
Earthy but sweet with a little heat. Would make a nice starter with some poppadoms and yoghurt or as a simple side to go with most curries, from a dhal to a dhosa to a dhansak. This is best made with our early crop bunched beetroot. 
Ingredients:
2 large beetroots or 3 smaller 1 green chilli 1 tbsp coconut oil, or sunflower will do. 2 tbsp desiccated coconut ½ tsp black onion seeds salt & pepper
Method:
Peel and finely grate the beetroots, with the edge you’d usually use for Parmesan. Deseed and finely chop the green chilli. Heat the coconut oil in the small saucepan and add the grated beetroot and green chilli along with 2 tablespoons of water. Add the coconut to the beetroots and cook gently for 10 minutes. Finish by stirring in the black onion seeds and seasoning with salt & pepper.
