Rhubarb, orange, pistachio and cardamom cake
Introduction:
Flavoured with delicate orange flower water and cardamon, and studded with tangy rhubarb and pistachios, this is a moist and delectable teatime treat or dessert. The cream cheese icing is a lovely touch, but you could also serve this with a drizzle of double cream or a dollop of crème fraîche instead. 
Ingredients:
150g light brown sugar 250ml sunflower oil, plus a little extra for greasing 3 eggs 1 tbsp orange flower water (optional) zest of 1 orange seeds from 12 cardamom pods ½ tsp ground ginger 300g self raising flour 350g rhubarb, cut into 1cm pieces 80g pistachios, finely chopped, plus extra for the topping (optional) 250g mascarpone or cream cheese 50g icing sugar, sifted zest of 1 orange 1 tbsp lemon juice
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease a 20cm cake tin and line with baking parchment. In a large bowl, beat together the sugar, oil and eggs. Stir in the orange flower water, zest, cardamom seeds and ginger. Fold in the flour. Stir in the rhubarb and pistachios. Pour into the tin and even it out. Bake for 1-1¼ hours on the middle shelf, until a skewer comes out clean. Keep an eye on it as it cooks and cover loosely with foil if it’s turning too brown. Turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool. To make the icing, beat together the mascarpone, icing sugar, orange zest and lemon juice. Spread over the top and sides of the cake once it has cooled completely. Sprinkle over some chopped pistachios, if using.
