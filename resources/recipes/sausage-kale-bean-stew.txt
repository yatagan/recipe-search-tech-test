Sausage, kale and bean stew
Introduction:
A hearty one-pot dinner of robust greens, cream white beans, tender sausages and celeriac. Nothing more is needed for a satisfying meal. Use a liberal hand in substituting or adding ingredients and quantities – any tin of beans will do, and other kinds of root veg will happily mix in. 
Ingredients:
500g pork sausages 100g bacon, cut into lardons 1 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, sliced ½ celeriac, in 2cm pieces 2 garlic cloves, crushed sprig thyme 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp tomato purée 100ml red wine 300ml chicken stock dash Worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 400g kale or cabbage, de-stalked & shredded 200g white beans, cooked salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the sausages and bacon in oil for 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan. Add the onion and cook for 10 minutes. Add the celeriac, garlic, herbs and tomato purée and cook for 2 minutes. Deglaze the pan with red wine (let it bubble around to catch any sticky bits), and add the stock, Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Return the sausages to the pan, cover and cook for 20 minutes. Add the kale and wilt for 10 minutes. Stir in the beans, season and cook for a final 5 minutes. Serve.
