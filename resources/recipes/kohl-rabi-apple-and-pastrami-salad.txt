Kohlrabi, apple and pastrami salad
Introduction:
With a trio of crunch – mild, nutty kohlrabi, sweet apple and piquant gherkins – this salad packs a real punch. The peppery, smokiness of the pastrami brings it all together. Serve as a light main with crusty buttered bread or as part of an al fresco dinner. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tsp sugar 4 tbsp olive oil 1 large kohlrabi, about 500g, peeled & cut into matchsticks 2 apples, cored & cut into matchsticks 100g pastrami, cut in bite-sized pieces 8 cornichons (small cocktail gherkins), cut into small pieces 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
Method:
Whisk all the mustard, vinegar sugar and oil dressing together in a large bowl. Toss the dressing in the kohlrabi, apple, pastrami, cornichons and parsley and stir to combine. Serve on the watercress.
