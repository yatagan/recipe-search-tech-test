Roasted jerusalem artichokes and potatoes in red wine
Introduction:
Jerusalem artichokes add fragrant nuttiness and red wine acid richness to this roast potato side. If you don't have thyme it also works well with rosemary. This goes with most simply cooked mains – meat, fish or vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
500g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed & cut into halves or wedges 500g potatoes, peeled & cut into similar sized wedges 150ml red wine 3 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed few sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Place the artichokes and potatoes in a baking dish. Add the wine, oil, garlic and thyme. Toss together and season. Roast for about 45 minutes, turning the veg half way through, until all are tender.
