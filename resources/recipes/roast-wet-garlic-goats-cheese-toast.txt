Roast wet garlic and goat's cheese toast
Introduction:
Wet garlic is the first garlic crop of the season, picked but not hung up to dry. It's sweet and mild with a creamier texture than dried garlic, and very lovely roasted. You could try using some mozzarella instead of the goat's cheese if you'd like a less piquant snack. 
Ingredients:
1 piece wet garlic 3 tbsp olive oil 4 slices bread for toasting 150g soft goat's cheese 4 handfuls salad leaves juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Chop the wet garlic into 1 inch pieces (include the whole piece, green leaves too). Drizzle with olive oil and place in a roasting tray. Season with salt and pepper. Bake until soft (20-30 minutes). You can cook the garlic up to a day in advance if you like – cover and keep in the fridge until needed. To serve, toast the bread. Spread generously with goats cheese. Pile the wet garlic and salad leaves on top of the toast and drizzle lightly with the remaining olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and some salt and pepper to taste.
