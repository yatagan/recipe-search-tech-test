North African beef and root vegetable stew
Introduction:
This is a lovely, warming stew replete with subtle North African spices. It's simple to make and reheats excellently. There's no need to be at all exact about the root veg you use â€“ just take whatever's in your box and chop them all to a similar size. This is good served with couscous for soaking up the rich juices. 
Ingredients:
450g diced beef or beef braising steak, each piece cut in half oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 800g mixed root veg - carrots, celeriac, parsnips, swede, peeled & chopped into chunks or lengths 1 large onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2cm piece fresh ginger, grated 1 tbsp ras al hanout (North African spice blend) 1 tsp garam masala 150ml red wine 400ml beef stock 1 stick cinnamon 1 tin cooked chickpeas 100g pitted prunes handful fresh parsley, chopped handful fresh coriander, chopped seeds from 1 pomegranate
Method:
Fry the beef in a little oil to brown on all sides. Remove from the pan. Add the roots, except the onion, and fry to colour slightly. Remove from the pan. Add a splash more oil if needed, turn the heat right down and add the onion. Fry gently for 10 minutes to soften without colouring. Add the garlic, ginger, ras al hanout and garam masala. Stir for 2 minutes. Add the beef back to the pan with the wine. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the stock, root veg and cinnamon. Cover and simmer for 1 hour. Keep an eye on the liquid and top up with more stock or water if needed (check your heat too, it may be too high). Add the chickpeas and prunes. Simmer for a further 15 minutes. Sprinkle over the herbs and pomegranate seeds to serve.
