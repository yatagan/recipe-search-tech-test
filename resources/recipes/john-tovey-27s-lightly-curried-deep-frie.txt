John Tovey's lightly curried, deep-fried celery strips
Introduction:
These spicy, salty, crunchy morsels make an excellent and unusual accompaniment to drinks. They're also good with a main of roast game. Only fill your pan half-full with oil to prevent any upsplash. 
Ingredients:
400-450g celery stalks milk for soaking 75g plain flour 5 tsp curry powder oil for deep-frying, e.g sunflower salt
Method:
Cut each stalk into 5cm pieces and then into 5mm thick strips. Soak in cold milk until you want to fry them. Mix the flour and curry powder and spread out on a baking tray or put into a roomy plastic bag. Drain the celery strips in a sieve, then tip into the flour mixture, mixing to coat evenly. Tip back into the sieve to shake off excess flour. Preheat a pan of oil to 180Â°C. Fry the strips in the oil for about 4 minutes in 3-4 batches, using the handle of a wooden spoon to stop them clogging together. Drain briefly on kitchen paper and serve immediately, sprinkled with salt.
