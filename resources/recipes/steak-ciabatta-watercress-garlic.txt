Steak ciabatta with watercress and garlic
Introduction:
There are sandwiches and sandwiches, and this one is on the luxurious, whole-meal end of the scale. If you're feeling lazy, a coating of mayonnaise on one side and Dijon mustard on the other is much better than ok, but making herb butter in advance raises the gastronomic bar. 
Ingredients:
50g warm butter squeeze of lemon juice 2 tbsp parsley, chopped ½ garlic clove, crushed to a paste with a sprinkle of sea salt 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 split ciabatta or french baguette 350g frying steak bunch watercress salt & pepper
Method:
Mash the butter, lemon juice, parsley, garlic and mustard together with a fork. Put the steak on a chopping board, then season and brush both sides with a little olive oil. Heat a griddle pan to a moderate heat and warm the bread (a slight crunch isn’t a bad thing). Quickly griddle the steaks and spread the warm bread with the herb butter. Surplus butter can be melted on the steaks in the pan. Lay out the bread, put the steaks on one half and pour the butter and juices on top. Add the watercress and second half of bread, press lightly and eat immediately.
