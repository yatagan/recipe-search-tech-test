Shoulder of lamb with preserved lemon
Introduction:
'At our farm shops we sometimes preserve our own lemons; you'll otherwise find them in a good deli. If the lamb/garlic combination seems a little passé use a Moroccan rub such as Ras el Hanout. The beauty of lamb shoulder is that you can cook it until the meat comes away from the bone, almost in shreds, and it is still deliciously juicy.' (Ben Watson) 
Ingredients:
1.8kg shoulder of lamb 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 garlic cloves, crushed bunch fresh oregano 250ml white wine for the couscous: 500ml vegetable bouillon 250g couscous 100g preserved lemon generous bunch fresh parsley generous bunch fresh mint salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 8. Rub the shoulder with oil, lemon juice and seasoning. Scatter with crushed garlic and torn oregano and roast for 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 160°C/Gas 3. Pour in the wine and cooking for a further 2½ hours - basting a couple of times and covering loosely with foil if it begins to dry out. Make the couscous towards the end of cooking time. Make the bouillon with boiling water and pour over the couscous, cover and leave to stand for 10 minutes. Rinse the lemon and pat dry, chop into small pieces. Finely chop all your herbs. Fold the preserved lemon, parsley and mint into the couscous, season to taste and serve with sliced lamb with pan juices.
