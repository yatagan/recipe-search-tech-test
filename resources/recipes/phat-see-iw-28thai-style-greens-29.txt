Phat See Iw (Thai style greens)
Introduction:
This heathy, fast and flavourful Asian-style recipe is the winner of one of our customer competitions.Try it with any type of greens – spring, summer, chard or even kale when in season. The darkest possible soy sauce is best for this. If you'd like a heartier meal, just up the proportion of noodle and egg – the quantities needn't be exact for it to make a lovely dinner. 
Ingredients:
50g rice noodles (any thickness - in Thailand it's normally made from either rice vermicelli or very thick strands) oil for cooking, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 4 garlic cloves, sliced 1 pack greens, roughly sliced ½ tsp sugar 1 tbsp sherry, mirin or Chinese cooking wine 2 tbsp ordinary soy sauce 2 eggs 1 tsp dark soy sauce 1 tsp chilli flakes 1 lime
Method:
Cook your noodles according to the pack instructions. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan (make sure you have one with a lid) and fry the sliced garlic for a few seconds. Add the sliced spring greens and fry for a few minutes, taking care that they don't burn. Add the sugar, sherry or mirin and ordinary soy sauce, plus a little water to prevent burning. Cover with a lid, turn down the heat and cook until the spring greens are cooked, but retain a bit of crunch. Check regularly and add a little more water if the greens appear to be sticking to the pan. Drain the noodles and stir them into the greens. Push the noodles and greens to one side of the pan and break the eggs into the other side. Raise the heat and stir the eggs as they set, then stir them into the greens and noodles. Add the dark soy sauce and stir in thoroughly. To serve, sprinkle on the chilli flakes, a generous squeeze of lime juice and any extra sugar to taste.
