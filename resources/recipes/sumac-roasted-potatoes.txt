Sumac roasted potatoes
Introduction:
Fruity-tart sumac powder is made from grinding the dried berries of the sumac bush. You can use it sprinkled on salads or kebabs or add a little to rice or couscous. You should find it in small jars or packets in Middle Eastern food shops or delis. Try these roasted potatoes with chicken breasts or thighs marinated for half an hour in a tablespoon of sumac, olive oil and minced garlic. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 heaped tsp sumac 1 tsp paprika 800g potatoes, scrubbed, skins left on. If using new potatoes, leave whole if small, or cut in half if larger. If using stored potatoes, cut into wedges salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Mix the olive oil, sumac and paprika in a bowl to combine. Add the potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat in the oil or spice mixture. Place in an ovenproof dish, season well and roast for about 45 minutes, or until cooked through.
