Spaghetti squash salad
Introduction:
This salad is a bit like a Greek salad, and could be made more so with the addition of feta cheese. Its a stand-alone vegetarian summer lunch, or could be served as a side with chicken or grilled halloumi. When raw, the flesh of a spaghetti squash is solid and similar to other squash; when cooked, the flesh falls into spaghetti-like strands. 
Ingredients:
1 medium-sized spaghetti squash olive oil salt & pepper 225g cherry tomatoes 1 lemon 6 spring onions, finely sliced 100g black olives, pitted & roughly chopped small bunch of basil 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
Method:
Preheat your oven to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Cut the squash in half, lengthways. Use a spoon to remove the soft seedy centre. Oil and season each half and then place them cut side down in a roasting tray. Add a dash of water to the tray and then bake for 30-40 mins until soft. Meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and lay them on a baking tray. Drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper. Place them on the shelf below the squash for 20 mins, until roasted but not colouring. Leave the squash to cool for 10 mins or so before using a fork to scrap the flesh away from the skin. Spread the strands of squash on a serving plate and dress with a drizzle of olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon juice. Scatter the tomatoes, spring onions and olives across the squash, followed by plenty of torn basil leaves and a scattering of sesame seeds. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve immediately.
