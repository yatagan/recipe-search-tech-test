Thai-style chicken and squash curry
Introduction:
Serve this punchy chicken curry in a bowl with steamed or boiled rice. If you've got sweet potatoes in your veg box, you could use these instead of squash, or try a small, sweet variety of pumpkin. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 450g skinless diced chicken 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated 2 garlic cloves, crushed 3 tbsp red Thai curry paste 800g squash, peeled weight, cut into large chunks 400ml coconut milk 150ml veg or chicken stock 4 kaffir lime leaves 2 of stalks lemongrass, left whole but bashed with a rolling pin to release the aroma handful fresh coriander, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large flameproof pan. Add the onion and chicken and fry for a few minutes, until the chicken is starting to brown and the onion is softening. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for a couple more minutes. Add the curry paste, squash, coconut milk, stock, lime leaves and lemongrass stalks and stir to combine. Increase the heat, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the squash tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve sprinkled with the coriander leaves.
