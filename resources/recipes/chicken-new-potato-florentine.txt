Chicken and new potato florentine
Introduction:
This is a good work night dinner or summer lunch of succulent strips of chicken and plump new potatoes mingled with creamy spinach. 'Florentine' in cooking has just come to mean dishes that feature spinach – as in eggs Florentine. 
Ingredients:
400g new potatoes, scrubbed clean & sliced 2 skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips 200g spinach, washed, stalks removed 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped 3 tbsp olive oil small handful fresh basil leaves, shredded 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated 4 tbsp crème fraîche
Method:
In a pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes for 4-5 minutes, until just tender. Drain and keep to one side. In a large, non-stick frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil. Fry the chicken strips on a medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink juices remaining). Place the chicken into a separate dish and keep to one side. Add a tablespoon more oil to the frying pan and add the garlic and spinach. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the spinach is just starting to wilt. Return the potatoes and chicken to the pan, add the crème fraîche and basil and gently stir to combine, season and warm through.
