Chilli con carne with mixed beans
Introduction:
Chilli con carne is a hearty, slow-cooked, one-pot dish that suits a family dinner. Just be conservative about the quantity of chilli you use if your children are small. Serve with rice or over baked potatoes, with grated cheese and yoghurt or sour cream. You could also add a topping of homemade salsa for a layer of fresh, sharp flavour. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, chopped 3 garlic cloves, crushed & chopped 1kg minced beef ½ bottle red wine 2x400g cans chopped tomatoes 3 tbsp tomato purée 1-2 tsp of dried chilli flakes 1 heaped tsp ground coriander 1 heaped tsp ground cumin dash of Worcestershire sauce 2x400g cans mixed beans, drained fresh coriander leaves & wedges of fresh lime, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion and garlic over a low heat to soften. Now add the minced beef and increase the heat to brown it, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Pour over the red wine, bring to the boil for a couple of minutes, then stir in the tomato pur&eacutee, chopped tomatoes, chilli, ground coriander and cumin and Worcestershire sauce. Season to taste. Cover with a lid and simmer gently for 50 minutes-1 hour, stirring occasionally. It should be rich, red, and thickened. Finally, add the mixed beans, stir in gently and cook for a further 10 minutes with the lid off. Adjust seasoning if necessary.
