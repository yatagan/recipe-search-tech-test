Roasted cauliflower with lemon, caraway and mint
Introduction:
Sweetly nutty roasted cauliflower is set off by sharp lemon and earthily aniseed caraway seeds in this vegetarian side. For added complexity, garnish with fresh parsley or coriander if you’ve got some to hand; or punctuate with the saltiness of a handful of chopped black olives or the sweetness of raisins soaked in a cup of water for 20 minutes to plump them up. 
Ingredients:
1 small cauliflower olive oil zest & juice of 1 lemon 1 tsp caraway seeds small bunch fresh mint, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 7. Remove the leaves and central stalk from the cauliflower and break the head into bite-sized florets. Place them in a roasting tray, toss with oil and a generous seasoning of salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes; they should just be starting to colour. Remove from the oven and add the caraway, half the lemon zest and a dash of the juice. Throw together and roast for another 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the salt, pepper and lemon to your taste. Add the mint and serve.
