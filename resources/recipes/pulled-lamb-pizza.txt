Pulled lamb pizza
Introduction:
This recipe calls for a little effort in the dough-making department, but it yields sumptuous crisp flatbreads. Get creative with you toppings, then eat it either in slices, folded, or rolled up like a giant taco. You could also make snack-sized pizzas for a more elegant eating style! If you want further delights, add a bowl of hummus on the side.
Ingredients:
300g cooked lamb shoulder, shredded 1 onion, peeled & finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, peeled & finely chopped 100g pumpkin seeds generous handful of roughly chopped flat leaf parsley or coriander or both toppings of your choice - hummus, flavoured labneh, beetroot borani, za’atar, harissa, pickled jalapeno etc for the pizza dough: 7g dried yeast 275ml warm water 1½ tsp caster sugar 400g white bread flour 100g fine semolina flour ½ tsp salt 50ml olive oil for the pickled vegetables: 375ml cider or white wine vinegar 375ml water 250g caster sugar ½ tsp fennel seeds 10 peppercorns 1 star anise 1 small head of fennel, very finely sliced ½ small green cabbage, core removed & very finely sliced
Method:
First make the pickles. Boil the vinegar, water, sugar and spices for 5 mins and pour over the cabbage and fennel. Leave to pickle overnight or for a couple of hours. Make the dough by mixing the yeast with a little of the water and the sugar. Once frothing, mix in everything else and knead to a smooth dough. Cover and leave until it begins to rise. Meanwhile, quickly toast the pumpkin seeds in a dry frying pan until beginning to brown. Next, fry the onion and garlic until soft. Mix in the lamb. Divide the dough into four and roll out into pizza based sized discs. Divide the lamb mixture and spread onto the discs. Gently press down with your hands or the rolling pin and leave for 10 mins. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200°C/Gas
