Leeks in cheese sauce with rosemary fried crumbs
Introduction:
This sumptuous vegetarian leek dish takes half an hour to make and is an excellent weekday main. Eat with a pile of steaming rice or couscous to absorb the sauce. This is also good with ham, with buttery baked potatoes, or chopped up and stirred through pasta. 
Ingredients:
4-8 leeks, depending on size, trimmed & halved if large 50g butter 50g plain flour 550ml milk 200g Cheddar, grated ½ tsp nutmeg, grated 2 tbsp English mustard 1 tbsp sunflower oil 4 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs leaves from 1 sprig rosemary, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the leeks in boiling salted water for 4–6 minutes depending on size, until just tender. Drain well. Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Make the cheese sauce by melting the 50g of butter in a largish saucepan. As soon as the butter is melted add the flour and stir to cook the flour for 2 minutes. Add the milk, bit by bit, stirring constantly. Add the grated Cheddar, nutmeg and mustard. Stir and season. Place leeks in an ovenproof dish and pour over the cheese sauce. Bake for 15-20 minutes until sauce is bubbling and browning. While leeks are baking, heat the oil in a frying pan and when hot, add the crumbs. Stir frequently to prevent burning. When crisp and golden stir through the chopped rosemary. Remove pan from heat. Season. When leeks are ready, sprinkle over the crumbs and serve.
