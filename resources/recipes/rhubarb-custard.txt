Rhubarb and custard
Introduction:
Some people are die-hard haters rhubarb, or custard, or both. But this is silky, comforting nursery food should convert them. It gives a beautiful visual contrast of pink on yellow, and a lovely contrast of tastes. 
Ingredients:
450g rhubarb, coarsely chopped 150g caster sugar grated zest & juice of 1 orange 3 cardamom pods (optional) 6 egg yolks 1 tsp cornflour 1-2 tbsp caster sugar 400ml double cream 200ml milk seeds from vanilla pod (or ½ tsp vanilla extract)
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Mix the rhubarb, sugar and orange juice and zest together and place in an ovenproof dish. Add the cardamom pods if using. Cover and bake for 30–45 minutes, until the rhubarb is completely soft. Remove from the oven, leave to cool completely and take out the cardamom pods if used. To make the custard, whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl with the cornflour and sugar. Bring the cream and milk to boiling point in a pan with the vanilla, then whisk gradually into the egg mixture. Pour back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a low heat for about 5 minutes, until thickened. Strain and serve with the rhubarb.
