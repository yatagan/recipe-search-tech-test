Lemon, rosemary and garlic marinade
Introduction:
This very simple marinade adds zest to all things griddled and barbecued: from chicken breasts, lamb chops and salmon fillets to summer veg such asparagus and courgette. For the best results, leave your meat, fish or veg to soak up the flavours for a minimum of half an hour before cooking. 
Ingredients:
1 lemon 2 rosemary stalks 4 garlic cloves olive oil
Method:
Peel the zest from the lemon with a veg peeler in long strips. Bash the rosemary, garlic cloves (skin and all) and lemon zest together in a pestle and mortar, this helps release the oils in the lemon and rosemary. Juice the lemon. Mix everything together with a dash of olive oil.
