Courgette, herb and poppy seed salad
Introduction:
This grated courgette salad with lots of herbs is a good simple way to enjoy the first courgettes of the year – or to use up a glut. It's a base you can play around with – add grated carrots for more crunch, or French beans or sugar snap peas. 
Ingredients:
zest & juice of ½ lemon, more to taste ½ tbsp mint leaves, finely chopped ½ tbsp parsley, finely chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 4 courgettes, cut into fine matchsticks or coarsely grated (if grating, gently squeeze out any excess liquid) 1 tsp poppy seeds salt & pepper
Method:
Combine the lemon zest and juice, herbs and olive oil in a bowl. Add the courgettes and poppy seeds and toss together to coat. Season to taste.
