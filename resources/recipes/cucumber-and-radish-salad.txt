Cucumber and radish salad
Introduction:
This simple, crunchy, delicate salad is a great counterbalance to highly spiced or very hearty mains. It also makes a lovely, refreshing side to chicken or fish on a hot summer day. 
Ingredients:
2 cucumbers bunch of small red radishes, trimmed & quartered 2 tbsp sunflower oil 1 tsp brown mustard seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 chilli, chopped 2 tbsp lime juice (or lemon juice) 75g cashew nuts, roasted 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the cucumbers, cut them lengthways in half and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Cut the flesh into 1cm dice and combine with the radishes in a bowl. Heat the sunflower oil in a small frying pan, add the mustard and cumin seeds and cook over a medium heat for about a minute, until the seeds begin to pop. Add the chilli and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Pour the mixture over the cucumber and radishes. Add the lime juice, cashews and coriander, season to taste, then toss to combine.
