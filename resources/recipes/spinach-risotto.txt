Spinach risotto
Introduction:
It's easy to substitute the Parmesan for a vegatarian equivalent. You could also throw in a handful of peas, broad beans or chopped asparagus at the last minute. This quick recipe works best with fresh spinach, which we harvest from June to November. 
Ingredients:
200g spinach 150ml water 400ml vegetable stock 150ml dry white wine 150g butter 1 onion, finely diced 300g Arborio rice 50g pine nuts 125g ricotta cheese 25g Parmesan salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the spinach for 2 minutes. Drain, keeping the liquid, refresh in cold water and chop spinach finely. Mix the cooking water with the stock and white wine and keep warm. Melt half the butter in a large, heavy pan, fry onions for 5 minutes until soft and transparent. Add rice and pine nuts and stir very well. Add some liquid, stirring until the rice has absorbed the liquid, add more stock, continue adding stock until it has reached the consistency desired, the rice should be al dente (which means to bite), about 20 minutes. Stir in the spinach, butter, seasoning, ricotta, Parmesan and serve.
