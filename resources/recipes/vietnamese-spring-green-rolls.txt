Vietnamese spring green rolls with sesame soy dipping sauce
Introduction:
These fresh vegetarian spring rolls call for quite a few ingredients, but you should have most of them in your cupboards. They're very quick to prepare and fun to roll up – if you're feeding a few people, employ the hands of your guests. If you can’t get spring roll wrappers, use filo pastry: lay on an oiled surface, wrap as below, brush with oil and bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 12-15 minutes until golden. 
Ingredients:
100g rice noodles 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsp oil for frying at a high heat, e.g. rapeseed ½ large leek, finely shredded 200g spring greens, shredded, tough stalks removed 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 1 chilli, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar 8 rice spring roll wrappers small handful fresh coriander, chopped small handful fresh mint, chopped for the dipping sauce: 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar ½ tsp caster sugar 1 red chilli, finely chopped 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted in a dry pan until golden 2 tbsp cold water
Method:
Cook the noodles according to the packet. Drain, put in a bowl and toss in sesame oil, then leave to one side. Heat the frying oil in a wok and fry the leek for a couple of minutes. Add the greens, ginger, chilli and garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add the soy and rice wine vinegar. Have a heatproof bowl of hot water and a bowl of cold water ready. Dunk a wrapper in the hot water for a few seconds until it starts to wilt. Remove with tongs, dunk in the cold water, then lay on a work surface. Layer on some noodles, then spring greens, then herbs. Fold in each edge and roll into a cylinder shaped parcel. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers. To make the dipping sauce, whisk all the ingredients together. Serve alongside.
