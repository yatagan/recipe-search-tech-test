Chicken stock
Introduction:
Chicken stock is a cooking staple – useful for everything from stews to cooking grains. The homemade kind is the best there is – so never throw away the carcass after you've roasted a chicken. If you don't want to use this immediately it freezes well: boil it down to an intense brown stock so that it takes up less space in the freezer. 
Ingredients:
1 chicken carcass 1 onion, halved 1 leek, chopped 1 carrot 1-2 celery stalks a few parsley stalks or bouquet garni (mixed herb sprigs & a bay leaf, tied with string) a few black peppercorns salt
Method:
Put the chicken carcass in a large saucepan or stock pot with the veg. Add the parsley stalks or bouquet garni, a few black peppercorns and a good pinch of salt. Cover with water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer slowly for 1½ to 2 hours to make a stock, skimming off any fat every now and then. Strain the stock and leave to cool. Freeze what you don’t want to use in the next day or two. Use to make soups, stews and in risottos.
