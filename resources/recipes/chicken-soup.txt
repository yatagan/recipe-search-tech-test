Chicken soup
Introduction:
This is a really comforting chicken soup. The better your stock is, the better your soup will be. It’s even better the next day (but refrigerate it overnight). The tarragon is a lovely addition if you like it, though the taste is very distinctive and best left out if you are unsure. 
Ingredients:
1 litre chicken stock 1 glass white wine 1 bay leaf few sprigs of thyme 3 carrots, cut into batons 2 sticks celery, finely sliced 3 courgettes, in 1 inch slices, halved first if large 2 large or 4 small potatoes, in 2cm chunks 400-500g leftover roast chicken, torn into pieces, or 4 chicken legs, poached in the stock, removed from bone & set aside 3 leeks, finely sliced 2 handfuls flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped drizzle of olive oil juice of ½-1 lemon (optional) 1 handful tarragon, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Bring the stock and wine to a simmer in a pan. Add the bay leaf, thyme and all the vegetables except the leeks. Simmer until everything is tender but not too soft (about 10-15 minutes). Add the shredded chicken and leeks and bring to the boil. Make sure everything is warmed through and that the leeks have softened, then season to taste and add the parsley, olive oil, lemon juice and tarragon, if using.
