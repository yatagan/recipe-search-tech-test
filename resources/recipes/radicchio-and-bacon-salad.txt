Radicchio and bacon salad
Introduction:
This healthy, clean-tasting salad makes use of a great combination of pleasantly bitter salad leaves and crispy, smoky bacon. Elegant and simple to make. 
Ingredients:
300g radicchio, escarole, endive or preferably a mixture small handful chives, chopped 150g smoked streaky bacon 2 shallots (or small leek or onion) 2 tbsp vinegar 3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Wash, dry and shred the leaves into a salad bowl with the chives. Dry fry the bacon. When it has released a little fat add the shallot or onion and continue frying for 2 minutes. Drain and add to the leaves. De-glaze the pan with the vinegar (add vinegar to the hot pan and slosh it around so it picks up all the flavour from the pan) and pour the liquid over the salad. Add the oil. Season and toss well. Serve immediately.
