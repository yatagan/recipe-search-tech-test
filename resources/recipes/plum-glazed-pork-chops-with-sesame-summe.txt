Plum glazed pork chops with sesame summer greens and noodles
Introduction:
A quick and delicious mid-week dinner. These Asian-style pork chops are succulent and moreish. They pair beautifully with noodles tossed in sesame oil and tender summer greens. You could also used brown rice noodles rather than egg noodles, and chard or spinach in place of summer greens. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp plum jam 1½ tbsp soy sauce ½ tsp allspice ½ tsp chilli powder 4 boneless pork loin chops 200g dried medium egg noodles 1 tbsp sesame oil 3 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. sunflower 1 large bunched onion, sliced 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced or chopped 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely sliced or chopped 400g summer greens, tough stalks removed, finely sliced 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
Method:
Gently warm the plum jam, soy sauce, allspice and chilli powder in a small saucepan for 2-3 minutes until the jam has become runny. Leave in a warm place. Heat the grill to medium, place the pork chops on foil or in a grill tray and grill for 6-8 minutes on each side, depending on thickness, until just cooked through. About two thirds of the way through cooking, brush the plum and soy sauce onto each side. While the pork is cooking, in a large pan of simmering water, cook the noodles for 2 minutes. Drain, toss in sesame oil and leave to one side. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large pan and add the onion, chilli, garlic and ginger. Fry for a minute or two, then add the greens. Stir to combine, cover and cook gently for 4 minutes (add just a little water if the greens start to catch on the bottom of the pan). Add the noodles and toasted sesame seeds to the greens, stir to combine and serve with the cooked pork chops (pour any cooking juices from the foil onto the chops).
