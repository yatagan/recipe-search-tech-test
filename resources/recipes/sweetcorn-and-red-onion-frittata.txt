Sweetcorn and red onion frittata
Introduction:
Frittatas are great for a last minute dinner, light lunch or picnic. This one's quick to prepare and can be dressed up many ways: for a Mexican version, include jalapeno peppers, bacon and black beans. For an Asian version, omit the Parmesan and nutmeg, add spring onions and chilli and serve drizzled with oyster sauce. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 red onion, diced 1 garlic clove, crushed 4 corn cobs, cooked nutmeg, grated 6 eggs 1 tbsp fresh herbs, such as coriander, parsley or chives, chopped 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated 400g tin kidney beans salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and garlic and cook over a moderate heat for 5â€“10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the corn and season well with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then remove from the heat. Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix in the corn and onion, plus the herbs, Parmesan, kidney beans and some seasoning. Heat the remaining olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the frittata mixture and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the frittata is set underneath and still slightly runny on top, running a spatula around the sides to make sure it is not sticking. Place the pan under a hot grill for 1 minute to cook the top. Slide the frittata out of the pan and leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then cut it into wedges to serve.
