courgette, fennel & kohlrabi salad
Introduction:
Riverford Cook Anna is a big fan of using courgettes, fennel and kohlrabi raw, so this simple salad pairs the crunchy raw veg with citrus and spice. The fennel seeds accentuate the fennel bulb’s natural flavour, while the caraway is a good match for the brassica flavour of the kohlrabi. If you don’t have all the spices just use those which you do. Cut the veg as thinly as you can (or use a mandolin). 
Ingredients:
1 courgette 1 fennel bulb, trimmed & fronds reserved 1 kohlrabi, peeled several large mustard leaves, or other peppery salad leaves, e.g. rocket For the vinaigrette ¾ tsp fennel seeds ¼ tsp caraway seeds juice of ½ lemon juice of ½ orange 5 tbsp olive oil salt & black pepper
Method:
Halve the courgette lengthways and slice each half crossways on the diagonal as thinly as you can. Quarter and core the fennel, then slice as thinly as you can. Cut the kohlrabi into matchsticks. Lay the mustard leaves on top of each other, roll up like a cigar and cut into thin ribbons. Make the vinaigrette by grinding the seeds with a pestle and mortar and then mixing in the citrus juices and enough olive oil to balance their acidity. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss all ingredients together, check for seasoning and serve garnished with the reserved fennel fronds.
