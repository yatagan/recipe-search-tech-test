Rhubarb and custard Pavlova
Introduction:
Rhubarb and custard are a classic combination which taste even better piled atop a feather-light meringue. If you don't have the time or courage to make a Pavlova base, use broken bought meringues and mix them with the whipped cream, poached rhubarb and custard to make a rhubarb Eton Mess. This recipe also works beautifully with fresh raspberries and strawberries. 
Ingredients:
for the meringue: 5 egg whites 300g caster sugar 3 drops of vanilla extract 1 tsp wine vinegar 1 tsp cornflour 2 tsp cocoa powder for the rhubarb: 500g rhubarb 100g brown sugar juice of ½ orange for the custard: 6 egg yolks 1 tsp cornflour 1-2 tbsp caster sugar 400ml double cream 200ml milk seeds from vanilla pod (or ½ tsp vanilla extract) 200ml whipped cream
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas ½. First make the meringue: With an electric beater, whisk the egg whites until just stiff, then gradually add the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, whisking after each addition until stiff peaks are formed. Fold in the vinegar, cornflour and cocoa, until the cocoa is mixed through the egg white. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Shape the meringue into 2 circles on the parchment, each about 25cm in diameter and 2cm deep. Place in the oven and leave for 1½ hours, until the meringue is firm to the touch. Turn the oven off and leave the meringue in it for 30 minutes. For the rhubarb: Chop some rhubarb into batons and cook gently in a little brown sugar and orange juice until tender but still holding its shape. Make the custard: Whisk the egg yolks in a large bowl with cornflour and sugar. Bring the cream and milk to boiling point in a pan with the vanilla, then whisk gradually into the egg mixture. Pour back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a low heat for about 5 minutes, until thickened. Fill the Pavlova with whipped cream and custard and cover with the poached rhubarb.
