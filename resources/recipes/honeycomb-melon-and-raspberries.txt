Honeycomb melon and raspberries
Introduction:
Honeycomb is fabulous eaten in golden shards sprinkled over quick-griddled melon and balanced out by the tart-sweetness of raspberries. Keep any leftover in an airtight container to scatter over vanilla ice cream.
Ingredients:
for the honeycomb: 200g caster sugar 5 tbsp golden syrup 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda for the fruit: 2 tbsp honey 1 tsp water 1 orange-fleshed melon, cut in 6 wedges 150g raspberries
Method:
Grease a 18x28cm tin, or one with similar capacity, with butter. For the honeycomb: Mix the sugar and syrup in a deep pan and cook over a gentle heat, without stirring, until the sugar has melted. Try not to let it bubble until the sugar grains have disappeared. Once completely melted, turn up the heat a little and simmer until you have an amber coloured caramel. Then turn off the heat and tip in the bicarbonate of soda as quickly as you can. Beat in until it disappears and the mixture foams. Scrape into the tin immediately (careful - itâ€™s hot!). It will carry on bubbling. Leave it and in about an hour, the honeycomb will be hard and ready to crumble or snap into chunks. You can keep any leftovers in an airtight container afterwards. For the fruit, mix the honey and 1 teaspoon of water in a small bowl, then brush a little onto both sides of each slice of melon. Heat a griddle pan until very hot. Griddle the melon on each side for 30 seconds. Serve with the raspberries, scattered with honeycomb.
