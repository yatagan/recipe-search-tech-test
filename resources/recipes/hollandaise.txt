Hollandaise
Introduction:
Try this silky, unctuous sauce with roasted or steamed asparagus or purple sprouting broccoli, or with grilled fish or eggs Benedict or a fillet of salmon. The addition of the cayenne, mustard and fresh herbs is optional. This isn't a difficult sauce to make, despite its reputation, but you need to keep whisking all the time to prevent the risk of curdling. 
Ingredients:
250g unsalted butter 3 egg yolks juice of 1 lemon pinch of cayenne 1 tsp grain mustard 1 tsp tarragon, chopped 1 tsp chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter slowly in a pan, then remove from heat. Whisk the egg yolks with the lemon juice and cayenne over a pan of simmering water until thick. Then add the melted butter a little at a time until all has been incorporated. Stir in the mustard and herbs, and adjust the seasoning.
