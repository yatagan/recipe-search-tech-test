Warm runner bean salad with fennel, apple and walnut dressing
Introduction:
We serve this regularly in the Field Kitchen and it gets a great response. The walnut dressing really makes this dish. Try it also in winter with leeks and cauliflower. 
Ingredients:
100g walnuts 1 tsp walnut oil pinch cayenne pepper 300g runner beans, sliced on the diagonal into 1–2cm lengths 2 apples, cored & cut into 1cm dice 1 fennel bulb, very finely shaved (a mandolin is good for this) for the walnut dressing: 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tsp honey 3 tbsp red wine vinegar 100ml sunflower oil 1 tbsp walnut oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Mix the walnuts with the walnut oil, cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt and spread them out on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and roast for 5 minutes, until lightly toasted. Remove and leave to cool. For the dressing whisk together all the ingredients and season to taste. Lightly crush half the walnuts and add them to the dressing. Cook the runner beans in a pan of boiling salted water for about 5 minutes, until just tender. Drain and toss with the apples, fennel, walnut dressing and the remaining walnuts. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Leave to sit for a while before serving, so the runner beans can absorb the flavours.
