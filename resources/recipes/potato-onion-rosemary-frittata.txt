Potato, onion and rosemary frittata
Introduction:
This thick, cushiony frittata (or tortilla) is good both warm and at room temperature. Enjoy half for dinner with a green salad and the rest for a picnic or packed lunch. Try adding in red peppers, marinated artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes or thin slices of chorizo. 
Ingredients:
120ml olive oil 2 onions, sliced 1.5kg potatoes, washed, peeled & thinly sliced 4 tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped 10 eggs, beaten salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the oven to a high temperature. In a heavy bottomed skillet or oven proof frying pan, put enough olive oil to just coat the bottom of the pan. Heat to a medium temperature then add the onions and stir until they have just started to colour. Add the potatoes and rosemary and continue to cook until the potatoes are golden. Add the rest of the oil, then the eggs, making sure the potato mixture is covered. Cook on the hob until the edge of the frittata appears to be firming up, then place in the oven until the top is cooked.
