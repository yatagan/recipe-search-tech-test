Courgette and tomato soup with basil croutons
Introduction:
Make the most of summer's bounty with this simple, bold soup topped with basil-baked croutons. It's good both warm and chilled, and freezes well if you've got a glut of courgettes and tomatoes. Add a pinch of chilli if you're a heat-lover, or a spoonful of crème fraîche to serve. 
Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped 2 sticks celery, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp tomato purée 3 large courgettes, diced 5 tomatoes, chopped 1 litre veg stock for the croutons: 3 tbsp olive oil 3 thick slices sourdough or ciabatta, cut into 1½-2cm dice 8 basil leaves, finely shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the onion and celery gently in oil for 8 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic and tomato purée. Fry for 2 minutes. Add the courgette and fry for 3 minutes. Add the tomatoes and stock and season. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Blitz in a food processor. To make the croutons, heat the oil in a non-stick pan. Add the bread and basil and season. Fry on a low heat, turning now and then, until golden. Drain on kitchen paper. Reheat the soup if needed and serve with the croutons. Or you could serve this chilled on a hot day.
