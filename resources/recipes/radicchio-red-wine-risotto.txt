Radicchio and red wine risotto
Introduction:
In this sophisticated-tasting recipe the bitterness of radicchio and tannins of the red wine are beautifully balanced by creamy rice. This risotto is lovely garnished with parsley or toasted walnuts, or with a crumbling of chorizo, bacon or pancetta. You could also use some good stock in place of the wine, although the colour will be less exquisite. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 50g butter 1 onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped ½ large or 1 small radicchio, finely sliced 400g risotto rice 300ml red wine 1½-2 litres veg or chicken stock 3 tbsp Parmesan or Pecorino, grated pepper
Method:
Heat the oil and butter in a heavy-based casserole over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook slowly for 5-7 minutes until soft. Add the radicchio and rice and stir. Pour in the wine. Stir for 1-2 minutes. Add the hot stock a little at a time, stirring continuously, until the stock is absorbed (about 20 minutes). When cooked, the rice should be tender but firm in the centre. Mix in the Parmesan. Season with black pepper to taste.
