Strawberry and elderflower bubbly jellies
Introduction:
This is a juicy, light and beautiful summer dessert. It's easy-to-make and keeps in the fridge well for 4 or 5 days. You can make it with any fresh berries you like – a combination of raspberries, blueberries and strawberries is especially good. 
Ingredients:
12g sachet gelatine powder (or a 6.5g pack of vegetarian gel) 450ml Luscombe elderflower bubbly, chilled in the fridge 200g strawberries, cut into quarters or sliced, chilled in the fridge
Method:
Pour 120ml just-boiled water into a large heatproof jug or bowl. Stir in the gelatine, mixing well to dissolve all the powder. If it doesn’t all dissolve, put in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, and stir until it does. Add the elderflower bubbly and stir well. Divide the strawberries between your bowls. Pour over the elderflower mixture. Wait for a minute or two to let the mixture settle, then dab away any froth with kitchen paper. Chill until set, about 1 hour.
