Roasted broccoli with capers and black olives
Introduction:
Roasting is a good way to bring out broccoli's delicate taste and give it a bit more of a bite. This vegetarian recipe goes very well with fish and tomato based dishes. 
Ingredients:
350g Calabrese (broccoli), broken into florets, stalks cut into thick batons 1 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced ½ red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped ½ tbsp sesame seeds (optional) 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp capers handful black olives, pitted 2 spring onions, sliced 2 red peppers, sliced & roasted
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Toss the broccoli in the oil, season and spread it out on a baking tray and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chilli and sesame seeds, if using, and mix through. Return to the oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle immediately with the soy sauce and toss with the capers, olives, spring onions and red peppers.
