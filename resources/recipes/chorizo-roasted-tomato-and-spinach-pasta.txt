Chorizo, roasted tomato and spinach pasta
Introduction:
A colourful and tasty way to use chorizo as a meat seasoning, crumbled and fried, then added to pasta and spinach with roasted tomatoes. Easy and quick, a great mid-week dinner dish. 
Ingredients:
400g spinach, washed, leaves stripped from their stalks 400g short pasta shape e.g. fusilli or penne oil for frying e.g. sunflower or light olive 300g cooking chorizo, casings removed, meat chopped or crumbled into chunky pieces 450g cherry tomatoes, cut in half, crossways a splash of stock or water (use the pasta cooking water for this) salt & pepper
Method:
Put 2 large pans of water on to boil, one well-salted for the pasta. Once the water comes to the boil, get a large bowl of cold or iced water ready. Add the spinach to the unsalted pan. Cook for 1 min, until wilted. Drain and refresh in the bowl of cold water. Drain again, squeeze out excess liquid and roughly chop. Add the pasta to the other pan. Cook according to the pack instructions, until just tender (al dente), while you make the rest of the dish. As soon as the pasta goes in, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan. Add the chorizo and stir-fry on a medium-high heat for 5 minutes, until it lightly crisps up and releases its paprika juices. Add the tomatoes and a good splash of stock, or some of the water from the pasta pan. Cook for a further 3 minutes. Drain the pasta once cooked, reserving a little of the cooking water. Add the pasta and spinach to the chorizo pan with a little of the reserved pasta water to make more of a sauce. Season with salt and pepper, gently toss everything together and serve.
