Miso soba noodles with shiitake, sea salad & spring veg
Introduction:
This is a veg-packed noodle bowl, using umami (savoury) flavoured miso for a warming and healthy supper. We’ve advised using 1 litre of water, but you can add a little extra (100ml or so) if you prefer more of a broth, there’s plenty of flavour in the miso to carry it.
Ingredients:
150g shiitake mushrooms 2 eggs 250g asparagus 1 pak choi 2 large spring onions 1 pack mixed sprouted seeds 2 tbsp brown rice miso 200g soba noodles 1 tbsp tamari 1 lime pot dried sea salad few parsley leaves
Method:
Put a large pan of water on to boil for the noodles. Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp piece of kitchen paper or clean cloth. Chop any larger ones in half. Put the eggs in a small pan. Cover with water. Bring the pan up to the boil. Cook for 7 minutes. Drain and leave to cool in a bowl of cold water. Prepare the asparagus by washing them and then snapping each spear towards the woody end. Discard the bottom parts where they snap off, as they’re the tough bits. Cut the pak choi in half. Trim and slice 2 large or 3 smaller spring onions at an angle. Wash a good handful of the sprouted seeds. Cook the noodles in the pan of boiling water, according to the pack instructions. Drain and refresh under cold water to stop them sticking. Put the miso in a large pan. Add 500ml water. Bring up to a simmer. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 2 minutes, then scoop them out. Add the asparagus and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until just tender, then scoop them out. Add the pak choi and simmer for about 2 minutes until just tender, then scoop it out. Add tamari and lime juice to the miso to taste. Peel the eggs and chop into quarter’s (see cook’s note). Pick a few leaves of parsley. Divide the noodles between 2 serving bowls. Arrange the mushrooms, asparagus and pak choi over the top. Pour over the warm miso (it will reheat the noodles and veg). Top with the sprouted seeds, peeled eggs, sea salad and parsley.
