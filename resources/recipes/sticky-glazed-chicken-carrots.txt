Sticky glazed chicken and carrots
Introduction:
This chicken and veg recipe takes half an hour and is good for a midweek dinner. Eat it on its own for complete ease of cooking, or with with mustard mash and a salad. You could also make it with chicken breasts, but legs are cheaper and often tastier. Make sure the chicken juices run clear before eating. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 4 chicken legs 8 good sized carrots, peeled & cut into thick batons or quarters 1 small bulb wet garlic, finely chopped (or use 2 cloves crushed/chopped garlic) 2 tbsp sherry vinegar 3 tbsp maple syrup 150ml chicken or veg stock sprig of fresh thyme leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. In a large flame and oven-proof casserole dish, heat the oil and fry the chicken on both sides until golden. Remove to a plate or some kitchen paper. Add the carrots and garlic and fry for a couple of minutes. Add the vinegar to the pan, loosen all the bits off the bottom of the pan, then add the maple syrup, stock and thyme. Add the chicken, spoon over some of the juices and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink juices) and the sauce has become sticky. If you need to reduce the sauce, plate your chicken and carrots and boil the remaining juices on the hob for a couple of minutes until it’s a sticky glaze. Pour over the chicken to serve.
