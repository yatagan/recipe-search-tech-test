Teriyaki Pork & braised radishes with green beans & star anise rice
Introduction:

Ingredients:
100g brown basmati rice 2 star anise 25g ginger 1 garlic clove 1 fresh chilli 125g French beans 15g coriander 1 bunch radishes 1 tablespoon mirin 250g pork stir-fry strips oil for frying (e.g. sunflower) 2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce
Method:
Rinse the rice & add to a saucepan with a good pinch of salt & the star anise. Cover with plenty of boiling water, stir once & simmer for 20-25 mins, until tender but still with a little chew & ‘bite’ Meanwhile, peel & finely grate the ginger, finely chop 1 peeled garlic clove, remove seeds & slice the chilli. Trim the French beans. Slice each one into 3 or 4 pieces, at an angle. Roughly chop the coriander, stalks & all. Remove the green radish leaves. If any still seem perky keep them to one side. Slice the smaller radishes in half & larger ones into quarters. Put a wok on to heat. Add the mirin, 2 tbsp water, radishes & a pinch of salt. Cook on a high heat, stirring often, for 3-4 mins, until the liquid has reduced to nothing. The radishes should be partly cooked but still have a slight bite to them. Remove from the heat & keep to one side. Season the pork with salt. Heat 1 tbsp oil in the wok. When hot, add the pork & beans. Stir-fry for 3-4 mins, until the pork has coloured & the beans softened. Add the ginger, garlic, chilli & radishes (plus any reserved leaves). Fry for 30 secs before adding the teriyaki sauce & 2 tbsp water. Fry for 1 more min, until the sauce has reduced & looks glossy. Drain the rice, remove the star anise & serve with the pork, beans & radishes. Garnish with chopped coriander.
