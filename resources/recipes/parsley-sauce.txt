Parsley sauce
Introduction:
This an old-fashioned, nursery food kind of sauce. Creamy and herby, it goes with a dinner of gammon and peas; or with baked cod and fondant potatoes; or with fish cakes and broad beans. 
Ingredients:
450ml milk 50ml double cream parsley stalks ½ onion, peeled 1 bay leaf 1 blade mace 6 peppercorns 40g plain flour 40g butter 8 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped lemon juice salt & pepper
Method:
Put the milk and cream in a pan and heat together with the parsley stalks, onion, bay leaf, mace and peppercorns until it reaches boiling point. Remove from the heat, cover and leave to cool and let the milk get infused with all the flavours. Strain the infused milk through a sieve, discarding the spices, onion etc. Melt the butter in a saucepan together with the flour, stirring together with a wooden spoon. Once it’s foaming, whisk in the cooled milk and continue to whisk until the sauce has begun to bubble and is thickened. Remove from heat and add the chopped parsley before seasoning with salt, pepper and some lemon juice to taste.
