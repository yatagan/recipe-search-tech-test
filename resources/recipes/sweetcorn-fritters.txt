Sweetcorn fritters
Introduction:
Our cooks have made literally hundreds of these over the years, especially at festivals, and are still cooking them today. They make a great canapés topped with guacamole and sour cream. Or serve them as a brunch dish, with rocket, avocado, bacon and some tomato salsa. Use tinned sweetcorn for an easy, store cupboard snack – although you lose the crunch and sweetness of fresh corn. 
Ingredients:
3 corn cobs 125g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder 2 tbsp polenta 1 tsp sugar 2 eggs 1 egg yolk 2 tbsp crème fraîche 125ml milk 2 tbsp butter 1 red chilli, finely chopped ½ red onion, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh coriander and/or chives, chopped 2 tsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the husks off the corn cobs, then cook them in boiling water for about 10 minutes, until just tender. Drain well and cut off the kernels Put the flour, baking powder, polenta and sugar in a bowl. Add the eggs and yolk and beat together. Gradually beat in the crème fraîche and milk until you get a thick, smooth batter. Heat half the butter in a pan until brown and add it to the batter. Add the chilli, onion, corn and herbs and season well. Heat the oil and the remaining butter in a frying pan until quite hot. Drop tablespoonfuls of the mixture into the pan and fry over a medium heat for about 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Serve immediately.
