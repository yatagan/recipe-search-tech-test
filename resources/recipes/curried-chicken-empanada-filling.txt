Curried chicken empanada filling
Introduction:
Empanadas are excellent to have around for picnics or school lunches. If you're making, make double and freeze a batch for emergencies. 
Ingredients:
2 leeks, chopped 2 tbsp olive or sunflower oil 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped small piece fresh ginger, finely chopped 300g boneless chicken (use the skin and bones for stock) 2 tsp curry powder Â½ tsp garam masala 1 tbsp ground almonds 1 tbsp sultanas 3 tbsp cream 2 tbsp tomato ketchup fresh breadcrumbs, as needed
Method:
Gently fry the leeks in the oil for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for another couple of minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients (except the breadcrumbs), cover and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in enough breadcrumbs to absorb any liquid and firm up the mix, and allow to cool before making your empanadas.
