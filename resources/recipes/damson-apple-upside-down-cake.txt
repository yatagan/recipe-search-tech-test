Damson & apple upside-down cake
Introduction:
On a good year, the damson and apple seasons should overlap – making this a proper seasonal treat. The damsons create a tart, jammy topping, while the grated apple keeps the sponge moist and sweet. Serve with whipped double cream. 
Ingredients:
400g damsons 250g unsalted butter, softened 50g demerara sugar 150g soft dark brown sugar 2 eggs 225g self-raising flour 1½ tsp mixed spice 3 apples, peeled, cored & grated
Method:
Preheat your oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Halve the damsons and remove the stones. Line a 24cm loose-bottomed non-stick cake tin with baking parchment. Spread 50g of the butter over the bottom and evenly sprinkle the demerara sugar over. Place the damsons on top, cut-side down, in an even pattern. Whisk the sugar and remaining butter together until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the flour, spices and grated apple. Gently fold everything together, until they are just combined. Pour the mix over the damsons in the tin and gently level it out with the back of a spoon. Bake for about 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5-10 minutes, then invert onto a plate to cool. Serve warm or cool, with cream.
