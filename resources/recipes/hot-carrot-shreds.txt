Hot carrot shreds
Introduction:
This easy, quick recipe softens carrots but doesn't mask their flavour. It's mild â€“ but you could add a little cumin, paprika and/or harissa for a more spicy, North African effect. Try sprinkled with feta and torn mint before serving. 
Ingredients:
25g butter 350g carrots, peeled & coarsely grated squeeze of lemon juice salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter and add the carrots and a little salt and pepper. Stir to coat evenly, then cook gently for about 5 minutes half-covered, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and serve.
