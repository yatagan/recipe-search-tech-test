Easy cauliflower cheese
Introduction:
A creamily delicious white-on-white vegetarian dinner which you can make in half an hour. You could also roast the cauliflower rather than boiling it, which takes longer but brings out a more intense, nutty flavour. Scatter over a generous handful of breadcrumbs before baking for a bit of crunch. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, cut into florets 150g Cheddar cheese, grated 250ml tub crème fraîche 1 tsp mustard; Dijon or coarse wholegrain, whichever you prefer pinch grated nutmeg salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cook the cauliflower in a large pan of boiling water for 6-8 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and put in a baking dish. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a small bowl, reserving 50g of the cheese. Season, spread over the cauliflower and toss in the baking dish to combine. Sprinkle over the rest of the cheese, then bake in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese has melted and turned golden.
