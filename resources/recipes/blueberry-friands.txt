Blueberry friands
Introduction:
Friands are little cakes made with ground nuts â€“ either almonds or hazelnuts. Usually baked in an oval shape, they're suitable for a muffin tin too. You can add different flavours to them. Here we've used blueberries from our grower on Dartmoor. You could sprinkle over other berries or even a few chopped plums, when in season.
