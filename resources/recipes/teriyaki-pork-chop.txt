Devon teriyaki pork chops 
Introduction:
Teriyaki is more of a cooking technique than a sauce (basting while cooking over a high heat). 
Ingredients:
400g boneless pork loin, skin removed, joint sliced into 1cm thick chops for the teriyaki sauce: 250ml dark soy sauce 100ml apple concentrate, or 1 tbsp honey 150ml cider vinegar 2 tbsp brown sugar 1 dried chilli 4 garlic cloves 1 thumb sized knob ginger, peeled 1 heaped tbsp Colman’s English mustard powder
Method:
Blend the teriyaki ingredients together in a blender. Put the chops on a plate or in a container and brush both sides with the teriyaki sauce. Leave to marinate for 1 hour. Heat a heavy griddle pan over a medium-high heat. Brush the pan with oil and carefully place the chops on their edges, fat side down around the edge of the pan – to get the fat good and crisp. After about 2 minutes, turn the chops onto their sides and brush with the teriyaki sauce. Turn over after 1 minute and brush again. Continue to turn every minute, brushing the top side, until the chops are done – about 8 minutes in total. There should be a good coating of blackened teriyaki sauce on the outside, but the inside should still be moist. Serve with rice and salad, or in a bap.
