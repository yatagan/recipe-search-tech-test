Fattoush salad with mooli
Introduction:
Variants on this healthy, crunchy veg and bread salad are eaten with practically everything in the Middle East. Mooli, or daikon, is a kind of radish that's milder and sweeter than our British one. Cut off any leaves and peel it, then slice it thin. If you can't buy one, ordinary radishes are good here too, though bear in mind that they'll be more peppery. 
Ingredients:
2 pitta bread 6 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted & ground 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 small garlic clove, crushed 1 small mooli, peeled & very finely sliced with a mandolin or sharp knife 3 ripe tomatoes, chopped 1 cucumber, diced 1 red onion, finely sliced 1 red pepper, diced small handful mint & parsley leaves, shredded feta cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Break the pitta into bit sized pieces. Place on a baking tray and toast for 5 minutes, until crisp. Leave to cool. Whisk the oil, lemon juice, cumin, vinegar and garlic in a large bowl. Add all the other ingredients except the feta and toss together. Season. Crumble over a little feta cheese to serve.
