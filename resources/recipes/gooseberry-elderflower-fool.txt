Gooseberry and elderflower fool
Introduction:
This is an easily thrown together yet ambrosial combination. If there is no fresh elderflower around when the gooseberries are ready, add a little elderflower cordial (about 2 teaspoons) instead. 
Ingredients:
300g gooseberries, topped & tailed 2 heads of elderflower, as fresh as possible 20g butter 2 tbsp caster sugar (or to taste) 250ml double cream
Method:
Put the gooseberries, elderflower, butter and sugar in a pan and cook over a low heat until the gooseberries start to soften and ‘pop’. Leave to cool. Remove the elderflower heads, mash the gooseberries with a fork and check the sweetness, adding more sugar if necessary. Whip the cream and fold it into the gooseberries. Chill before serving.
