Chicken with new potatoes and olive butter
Introduction:
This is the quickest sort of chicken dinner there is, and a lovely one for a midweek summer's evening. It just needs a side of greens or salad for completeness. Any leftover olive butter goes well with salmon or artichoke hearts, or just spread on toast. 
Ingredients:
100g butter, softened 100g green olives, pitted & finely chopped zest of 1 lemon 8 boneless chicken thighs 2 tbsp olive oil 800g new potatoes, scrubbed & sliced into Â½cm discs handful basil leaves, shredded salt & pepper
Method:
In a small bowl, mix the butter, olives and lemon zest together. Leave to one side. On a board, flatten the chicken thighs with your hand, or use a rolling pin. Season well. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the chicken for 4-5 minutes each side, or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink juices) and golden. At the same time as you fry the chicken, cook the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water until just tender (about 7-8 minutes). Drain the potatoes and serve with the chicken on top, dotted with the olive butter. Sprinkle over shredded basil leaves, and serve with steamed broccoli or summer greens, or a green salad.
