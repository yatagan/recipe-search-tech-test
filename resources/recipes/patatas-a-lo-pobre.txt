Patatas a lo pobre
Introduction:
A warm, filling recipe that's a good tapas or side to roast meat. It's traditionally from Andalucia and means, roughly, 'poor man's potatoes' (though there's nothing poor about the taste!). To turn this into a complete dinner, add slices of chorizo or black pudding and/or fried eggs towards the end of cooking. A sturdy green salad will complete the picture. 
Ingredients:
5 tbsp olive oil 4 medium potatoes, thickly sliced 2 medium onions, diced 2 red or green peppers, thickly sliced 2 bay leaves 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped handful flat leaf parsley, chopped (optional) 1 tsp wine vinegar (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Warm the oil in a large heavy pan – a big frying pan or wok is ideal. Add the potatoes and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the peppers, bay leaves and garlic with some salt and pepper and continue cooking for another 10-20 minutes until all vegetables are soft. The potatoes may break up but that’s fine. Covering the pan will speed up the cooking. Once everything is cooked any excess oil can be drained off if you like. Taste for seasoning. If using parsley and wine vinegar stir in the herbs and sprinkle with vinegar before serving.
