Roasted spiced butternut squash
Introduction:
This spiced squash is very easy to throw together and is good warm and at room temperature. It can be a starter, perhaps paired with bacon; tossed in a salad for a light lunch; served with other roast vegetables as a vegetarian meal, or with roast meats or stews. 
Ingredients:
1 butternut squash olive oil any or all of the following: red chilli flakes crushed or ground coriander seeds ground fennel ground cumin nutmeg & cinnamon, used sparingly salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6 Cut the squash in half lengthways, remove the seeds, then peel and slice into portion sized wedges (it's nice to do this lengthways). Smear all cut sides with olive oil, then add sea salt and black pepper and a scattering of the spices suggested, in any combination you like. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes, until the squash is tender and slightly caramelised.
