Chard pancakes
Introduction:
These savoury pancakes are a staple in South-West France. They're thicker in texture than a crêpe-style pancake, so don't expect them to spread in the same way over the pan. You can make them small, as a starter or side, or frying-pan-sized for a vegetarian main course. Serve with salad, fresh salsa and a dollop of crème fraîche. This is really luxurious with a bit of smoked salmon for the non-veggies. 
Ingredients:
150g plain flour 2 shallots or 1 small onion, peeled & chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled & crushed 2 eggs 250ml milk 5 large or 10 small leaves chard, tougher white stems removed & discarded, chopped (you need about 100g chopped leaves) your choice of flavouring (e.g. a handful finely chopped fresh herbs, a deseeded & finely chopped chilli, or a good grating of fresh nutmeg) oil for frying, e.g. vegetable orsunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Put all the ingredients except the chard, oil and your flavouring in a food processor and blitz to make a batter. Add the chard and blitz for a few seconds more. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in your flavouring. Heat a little oil in a small non-stick frying pan. Cook the pancakes in batches, adding a good ladle of the batter to the pan each time (or make a few little ones in the same pan). Even the mixture out and fry on both sides until golden. Keep warm in a low oven; put a layer of greaseproof paper between each pancake to stop them sticking together. They will be a slightly different texture to ordinary pancakes.
