Leeks and saffron rice
Introduction:
The distinctive flavour and beautiful hue of saffron lends a special edge to this quick vegetarian dish. Serve on its own with some crusty bread and roasted tomatoes drizzled with olive oil for a simple supper or eat as an accompaniment to grilled fish or chicken. 
Ingredients:
pinch saffron (about 10 threads) 3 sun-dried tomatoes, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 400g leeks, cleaned & trimmed, sliced into 4-5cm lengths 90g risotto rice 4 tbsp boiling water 225ml veg stock Â½ tbsp each fresh parsley & mint, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the saffron threads and sun-dried tomatoes into two separate bowls. Pour 2 tablespoons of boiling water over each and leave to steep. Heat the olive oil and add the leeks. Gently fry for 10 minutes, until softened. Add the risotto rice to the leeks, stir for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and saffron with their liquid, plus the veg stock. Simmer for 12-15 minutes, then leave to stand for another 5 minutes, until the rice is cooked through. Add the herbs and season.
