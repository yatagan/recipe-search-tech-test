Galettes with chard and Gruyère
Introduction:
Melted cheese, an egg and fresh greens housed in a nutty flavoured gluten-free buckwheat pancake. These look impressive, but they’re simple to cook. This is also good with spinach, Comté, ham, or sweet pancake fillings. The pancakes can be made in advance and frozen between sheets of greaseproof paper.
Ingredients:
100g buckwheat flour good pinch salt 5 eggs 300ml milk 400g chard, leaves stripped from their stalks 50g butter, melted sunflower oil, for oiling the pan 125g Gruyère or Cheddar, grated salt & pepper
Method:
To make the galette batter, sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add one egg, then whisk, adding the milk a little at a time, until you have a smooth batter. Leave to rest for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, blanch and squeeze the chard leaves then roughly chop. Stir the melted butter into the batter. Heat a lightly oiled non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Put a quarter of the batter into the pan, rolling it around to cover the surface of the pan. Cook for about a minute until golden on the underside, then carefully flip the galette over. Crack an egg into the centre. Scatter a quarter of the chopped chard and grated cheese over the whole galette and season with salt and pepper. When the underside is cooked to golden brown, use a spatula then your fingertips to lift then fold the edges of the galette into the centre to form a square. Serve immediately, repeating with the remainder of the batter and filling.
