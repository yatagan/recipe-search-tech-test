Chinese-style pulled pork
Introduction:
You can find recipes for pulled pork and slow roast Atafu pork in The Riverford Farm Cook Book but, as suggested by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Chinese spices also work a treat and add a bit of punch, making for some very tasty leftovers. Perfect with a bowl of braised lentils, in a warm potato salad or just served simply with plain boiled rice. 
Ingredients:
750g pork shoulder for the paste: 1 pinch chilli powder 1 pinch salt 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 finger ginger, finely chopped 1 tsp brown sugar 1 tsp Chinese five spice 2 tsp soy sauce 2 tsp sunflower oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas ½. Mix all the paste ingredients together. Make sure your joint is well scored and smear the paste liberally into the meat. Pay special attention to the rind, forcing the paste into the score marks. Place, skin-side down, on a trivet in a roasting tray and pour in a glass of water. Place into the oven. After 3½ hours in the oven, turn the heat up to 220°C/Gas 7, spoon some of the juices into a bowl and turn the joint over. Cook until the crackling crisps up. Take it out of the oven and gently remove the joint. Peel off the crackling, break into pieces and serve separately in a bowl. Slice or pull the pork into pieces. Serve with the roasting juices.
