Turkey sausages with red cabbage
Introduction:
It’s a pity turkey only comes around once a year because it is a great meat for processing – potentially even better than pork (the leg meat certainly has much more flavour). Feel free to treat them as normal sausages and cook them as such – with some sort of flavoured mash and onion sauce or gravy. However, given the popularity of red cabbage on the Christmas dinner table, a second outing with turkey seems like a good idea. It’s a lengthy recipe, but the red cabbage will keep for a good week in the fridge and if prepped in advance, could be on the table in 30 minutes. 
Ingredients:
1 large onion, finely chopped 50g butter 1 medium red cabbage, quartered, cored & shredded 2 tbsp dark brown sugar 3 tbsp cider vinegar 250ml stock 8 turkey sausages 2 bramley apples, grated or finely chopped 1 tbsp white flour, sieved 4 tbsp crème fraîche or cream 1 tsp English mustard powder salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 140°C/Gas Mark 1. In a heavy saucepan on the hob, gently sauté the onion in the butter for 10 minutes. Add the red cabbage, sugar, cider vinegar, stock and seasoning. Put the lid on and cook in the oven for 2½ hours. Meanwhile, quickly brown the sausages and tuck them into the cabbage for the last 15 minutes of cooking. Take the cabbage out of the oven and stir in the grated apple. Mix the flour with the crème fraîche and mustard powder in a large bowl. Pick out the sausages and mix in the red cabbage (a ladle at a time) with the crème fraîche mixture. Return everything to the saucepan with the sausages and cook on the hob over a gentle heat for another 10 minutes. Check the seasoning. The acidity of the grated apple should come through and the cabbage will be lusciously creamy.
