Smoked chicken, runner beans, spinach and pesto pasta
Introduction:
A speedy weekday dinner: nutty spelt pasta with wilted spinach, runner beans and smoky chicken, all tossed in a succulent dressing of pesto and Parmesan. The beans and spinach can be replaced with any other greens you have in your veg box â€“ just adjust the cooking time accordingly. For a pescatarian version, substitute the chicken with smoked mackerel or trout. 
Ingredients:
300g spelt pasta 200g runner beans, de-stringed with a peeler & cut at an angle into diamonds 100g spinach leaves, washed & chopped 2 smoked chicken breasts, sliced into batons 3 tbsp pesto large handful Parmesan, grated, to serve
Method:
Bring a large pan of well salted water to the boil. Add the pasta, give it a stir and cook for 4 minutes. Add the beans, bring back to the boil and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the spinach, cook for another minute and drain, keeping a little of the cooking liquid. Place the saucepan on a low heat and add a good glug of olive oil. Add the chicken, stir for a couple of minutes and add the pasta, veg and pesto. Keep stirring gently until everything is mixed together and back up to temperature. Serve with the Parmesan.
