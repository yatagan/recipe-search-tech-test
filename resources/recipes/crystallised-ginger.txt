Crystallised ginger
Introduction:
Sweet and spicy crystallised ginger can be enjoyed as is, or chopped up and added to cooking for an extra zing in cookies and cakes, and even in savoury dishes like pumpkin soup. Wrapped in cellophane and tied with a ribbon, it also makes a lovely Christmas gift. 
Ingredients:
500g fresh ginger sugar
Method:
Peel and thinly slice the fresh ginger, then place in a heavy-based saucepan. Cover with water. Cook gently for about 30 minutes until tender, then drain off the water. Weigh the cooked ginger and measure out an equal amount of sugar. Return the ginger to the pan, add the sugar and 3 tablespoons of water. Bring to the boil, stirring often, and cook until the ginger is transparent and the liquid has almost evaporated. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until almost dry. Toss the cooled ginger in more sugar to coat. Store in an airtight jar for up to 3 months.
