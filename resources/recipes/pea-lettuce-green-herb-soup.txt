Pea, lettuce and green herb soup
Introduction:
Cooking with a lettuce may seem a little odd but it is not uncommon. Added towards the end of cooking it retains its colour and clean fresh taste. This soup can be eaten hot or chilled. At this time of year I’d enjoy it warm with some dark rye bread and be cheered but the hint of the spring months ahead. 
Ingredients:
4 spring onions or 2 shallots or 1 small onion medium potato or a handful of cooked rice 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 bay leaf 200g podded peas 600ml chicken or veg stock ½ a large round lettuce, torn & washed 8 mints leaves, chopped small bunch of dill, chopped small bunch of parsley, chopped Crème fraiche or cream, optional salt & pepper
Method:
Clean, trim and slice the onions. Fry them gently in a little oil and butter for 5 minutes until softening but not coloured. Peel and finely dice the potato. Add it to the pan with the garlic and bay. Fry gently for another 2 minutes. Add the stock and simmer until the potatoes are soft. Add the peas and lettuce. Cook for a further 3 minutes before adding the mint, dill and parsley. Remove the bay and blend the soup into a bright green puree. Season with salt, pepper and a cautious squeeze of lemon juice. Finish with a blob of crème fraiche or a swirl of cream if you so desire.
