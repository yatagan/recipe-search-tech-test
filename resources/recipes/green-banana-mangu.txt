Green banana mangu
Introduction:
Boiled, mashed green bananas or plantains are a classic breakfast in the Dominican Republic.. They're often eaten with some cheese, salami, and fried/scrambled eggs. If this seems like a bit of a challenge first thing in the morning, you could also try this dish for dinner in place of mashed potatoes. Don’t even bother trying to peel them from top to bottom. Instead, remove each end and score down one side. Prise the skin open and work it away from the flesh all the way around. The skin can be sticky and sappy, so it’s best to wear gloves if you can; avoid getting any on your clothes as the juices can stain. 
Ingredients:
5 green bananas 1 red onion, sliced juice of half a lemon or 1 tbsp vinegar oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
First, peel your green bananas (take care not to stain your clothes with the juices, as explained above). Place the whole bananas in a pan of boiling, salted water, and cook for around 20 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, gently fry the onion in a little oil until translucent, add the lemon juice or vinegar and season before removing from the heat. Once the bananas are cooked, lift them out of the water and into a bowl. Mash as you would potatoes, adding the butter and using a little of the cooking water to loosen the mixture. Stir in the onions and season well to taste.
