One pot lamb and leek casserole
Introduction:
This comforting lamb stew takes a while in the oven but needs little attention. You can make it all in one pot, so it's great for minimising washing up. This is is goes well with mash – try celeriac and potato or parsnip – and lots of kale. You could also exchange some of the potatoes for any other root veg you fancy – parsnips, carrots, swede and celeriac. 
Ingredients:
50g butter 400g leeks, cleaned & cut into 1-2 cm slices 1 onion, or a small handful shallots, chopped (leave the shallots whole or cut in half) 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 750g stewing lamb, cubed 1 tbsp plain flour 750g potatoes, peeled & thinly sliced small handful fresh parsley, chopped a few fresh thyme or rosemary leaves, finely chopped (or use 1 tsp dried) 600-700ml lamb, chicken or veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150˚C/Gas 2. Melt half the butter in a large flameproof casserole dish. Add the leeks, onion and garlic, cook slowly for 10 minutes. Remove the veg from the pot, add the oil and brown the lamb in batches. Add the flour and cook for a minute or two longer. Remove the lamb and keep to one side. Layer some of the potatoes (about half) in the bottom of the pan. Season well with salt and pepper. Add the meat, leeks and onions. Layer the rest of the potatoes on top, to cover. Sprinkle with herbs and pour over 600ml stock. Cover and cook in the oven for about 2 hours. Check ¾ of the way through and add more stock if it looks to be drying out too much. Remove the lid, dot the potatoes with the rest of the butter and cook for another 30 minutes, until the potatoes have browned.
