Sweetcorn three ways
Introduction:

Ingredients:
sweetcorn
Method:
BBQ: One for the outdoors if the weather holds. Soak some corn (still in their husks) for half an hour in cold water. Place them on a BBQ and cook over medium coals for 20-25 minutes, until the husk has started to burn. Peel the husk back and rub the corn with salt and lime. Devour straight from the cob using the bunched husks as a heat proof handle. Butter: Strip away the husks and stringy silks, boil the corn for 12-15 minutes until tender. Rub with salted butter and gnaw from the cob. You can flavour the butter with any number of herbs, spices and chillies. Braise: Strip away the husks and stringy silks. Hold the corn vertically and strip away the kernels with a sharp knife. Braise them with some onions and garlic in a little white wine and stock until they are tender. Try adding some chopped spinach, chilli and even a swirl of cream at the end to enrich.
