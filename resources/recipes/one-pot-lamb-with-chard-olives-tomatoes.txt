One pot lamb with chard, olives and tomatoes
Introduction:
This hearty one-pot lamb dinner is very easy to make. One bowl of it is all you need for a completely satisfying dinner on a cold night – though a little crusty bread wouldn't go amiss for soaking up the last of the juices. It re-heats well, and is forgiving of substitutions – use kale or spinach instead of chard, or cannellini or borlotti beans in place of haricot. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 500g diced lamb (shoulder is good) 1 onion, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 500ml hot lamb or beef stock 400g tin haricot beans, rinsed & drained 3 large tomatoes, chopped (or use ½ a tin of chopped tomatoes) 100g pitted black olives 200g chard leaves (or use spinach), tough stems removed, roughly chopped 100g crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3 Heat the oil in a large, flameproof casserole pot. Fry the lamb in batches to brown the outside. Remove from the pan, add the onion and garlic and fry for a few minutes. Return the lamb to the pan, add the rosemary, stock and season. Place in oven and cook for an hour or so, until the lamb is tender Add the beans, tomatoes and olives. Cook for another 15 minutes. Add the chard and crème fraîche and cook until the chard has just wilted (about 8-10 minutes). Check seasoning before serving.
