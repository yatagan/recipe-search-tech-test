New potatoes with chilli and lime
Introduction:
Serve this quick and easy side with grilled fish or chicken. It also makes a good vegetarian meal with some fried halloumi and salad leaves. We harvest our new potatoes from late spring to mid-summer. They have much less staying power than main-crop potatoes so eat them within a week of getting them in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
800g new potatoes, cleaned 50g butter 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped grated rind & juice of 1 lime 2 tbsp fresh parsley or coriander, chopped
Method:
Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the potatoes, bring back to the boil. Simmer gently for 12-15 minutes or until cooked through. Drain well. Melt the butter in a large pan and add the chilli for about 30 seconds. Add the grated rind and lime juice, then the potatoes. Toss for a couple of minutes until heated through. Add some chopped parsely or coriander to serve.
