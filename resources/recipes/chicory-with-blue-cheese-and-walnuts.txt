Chicory with blue cheese and walnuts
Introduction:
Chicory is a lovely winter salad leaf â€“ bittersweet and crunchy. Here, is gives a great contrast to the creamy richness of the cheese and the sweet walnuts. This works well with most kinds of blue cheese. 
Ingredients:
4 heads chicory lemon juice 30g butter 125g blue cheese - Roquefort or a local blue 100ml double cream handful of toasted walnuts, slightly crushed salt & pepper
Method:
Quarter the chicory heads and blanch in boiling water with lemon juice for 2 minutes. Drain, cool and make sure that all the excess water is pressed out. Heat the butter until brown and add the chicory. Cook until chicory is coloured. Season well. Heat the crumbled cheese and cream together gently until the cheese starts to melt. Season with pepper to taste. Stir the cheese mixture into the chicory, bubble down until it coats the chicory. Sprinkle with walnuts.
