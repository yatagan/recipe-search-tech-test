Chicken & chorizo pasta with spinach
Introduction:
This is such a simple dish to cook and full of flavour from the paprika in the chorizo.
Ingredients:
250g cherry tomatoes 200g baby spinach 1 cooking chorizo oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or light olive 200g fusilli pasta 300g diced chicken breast splash chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Put 2 large pans of water on to boil, one well-salted for the pasta. While the water heats up, wash the tomatoes and spinach. Cut the tomatoes in half. Peel one of the chorizo sausages and roughly crumble it up. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Get a large bowl of cold water ready. Once the pans of water come to the boil, add the spinach to the unsalted pan. Cook for 1 minute, until wilted. Drain and refresh in the bowl of cold water. Drain again, squeeze out excess liquid and roughly chop. Add the pasta to the other pan. Cook for 10-11 minutes, until just tender (al dente), while you make the rest of the dish. As soon as the pasta goes in, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan. Add the chicken and fry on a medium-high heat to brown it (about 3-4 minutes), turning now and then. Make sure thereâ€™s space between each piece so they fry and brown, rather than just sweating. Once the chicken is golden brown, add the chorizo. Fry on a medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring now and then, until it lightly crisps up and releases its paprika juices. Add the tomatoes and a good splash of chicken stock to the chicken and chorizo. Cook for a further 3 minutes. Drain the pasta once cooked, reserving a little of the cooking water. Check the chicken is cooked through (cut into one to check no pink juices remain; cook for a little longer if needed). Add the pasta and spinach to the chicken pan with a little of the reserved pasta water to make more of a sauce. Season with salt and pepper, gently toss everything together and serve.
