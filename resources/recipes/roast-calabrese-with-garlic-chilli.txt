Roast Calabrese broccoli with garlic and chilli
Introduction:
This light and super-easy side is a great weeknight fall back. The chilli and garlic give traditional roast broccoli an extra zing. Watch the stalks carefully – they should be just tender and slightly coloured. 
Ingredients:
350g Calabrese (broccoli), broken into florets, stalks cut into thick batons 1 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced ½ red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped ½ tbsp sesame seeds (optional) 2 tbsp soy sauce
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Toss the broccoli in the oil, spread it out on a baking tray and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chilli and sesame seeds, if using, and mix through. Return to the oven for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, sprinkle immediately with the soy sauce and serve.
