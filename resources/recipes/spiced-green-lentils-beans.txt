Spiced green lentils and beans
Introduction:
A lovely vegetarian version of meatballs, these lentil balls in tomato sauce are rich and spicy and need nothing more than some rice, naan or pitta to be a perfect dinner. If don't have green beans you could stir in some chard, spinach or other greens for the last few minutes of cooking. 
Ingredients:
375g green lentils, soaked overnight in cold water 1 large onion 1 large potato 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp turmeric 90-100g plain flour oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 small piece ginger, grated 250ml passata or chopped tomatoes 500ml stock 250ml cream 2 carrots, thinly sliced or cut into small batons 200g green beans
Method:
Drain the lentils and place back in the bowl. Grate the onion and potato. Place the grated veg in a tea towel and squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Combine the squeezed, grated veg with the lentils, spices and flour and mix all the ingredients together. Line a tray or large plate with foil or baking parchment. Roll the mixture into small balls and place on the tray. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. In a large deep frying pan, add a little oil and on a medium heat, fry the balls in batches, until browned on all sides (about 5 minutes). Drain on kitchen paper. In a large pan, heat a little oil and add the garlic and ginger. Fry for a couple of minutes. Add the passata or chopped tomatoes, stock and cream. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, simmer for a few minutes. Add the lentil balls and simmer for 25 minutes. Add the carrots and beans and cook for another 5-10 minutes. Serve with rice, pitta or naan bread.
