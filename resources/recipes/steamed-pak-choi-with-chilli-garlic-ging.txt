Steamed pak choi with chilli, garlic and ginger oil
Introduction:
The best way to cook crisp, pert pak choi is very briefly, as with this recipe. Steamed then stir-fried with chilli, garlic and ginger, this pairs well with simple poached or pan-fried chicken and some steamed or boiled rice. Team it with stir-fried mushrooms or tofu if you're a vegetarian. You would also add a little finely shredded lemongrass to the garlic, ginger and chilli. 
Ingredients:
1 large pak choi, cut lengthways into halves or quarters, depending on size 2 tbsp oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 red chilli, finely sliced (seeds removed if you donâ€™t like it hot) 1 garlic clove, finely sliced 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & thinly sliced a little soy sauce & sesame oil, to serve (optional)
Method:
Steam the pak choi for 3-5 minutes, depending on size, until the stems are just tender. Meanwhile heat the oil in a small frying pan with the chilli, garlic and ginger. Heat gently for 2 minutes to warm through, without letting the garlic burn. Pour the chilli oil over the pak choi to serve, drizzled with a little soy and sesame oil if you like.
