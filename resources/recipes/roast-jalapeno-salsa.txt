Roast Jalapeño Salsa
Introduction:
A punchy salsa to use as a dip or condiment. Cooking the peppers and tomatoes adds a bit more complexity and depth to the flavour, but you could easily skip that stage for something fresher and more straightforward. 
Ingredients:
150g Jalapeño peppers 3 tomatoes, quartered ½ red onion, finely diced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped juice of 1 lime small bunch of fresh coriander, chopped 4 tbsp olive oil sea salt
Method:
Preheat your oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Place the peppers and tomatoes in a small roasting tray and oil them lightly. Roast for 15 mins, until the peppers have begun to blacken and the tomatoes are softening. Remove the tops from the peppers. Place the peppers in a blender with the tomatoes, onion, garlic, lime juice, coriander, olive oil and a good pinch of salt. Pulse into a chunky salsa. Taste and tweak with more salt to your liking.
