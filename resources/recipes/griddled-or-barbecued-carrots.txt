Griddled or barbecued carrots
Introduction:
This simple, quick recipe gets the best out of young carrots, offsetting their inherent sweetness with a lightly seasoned smokiness. The carrots are good warm or cold. They go well with pretty much anything cooked on the barbecue. 
Ingredients:
zest & juice of 1 lemon 150ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, chopped 450g small carrots, scrubbed (or larger carrots halved lengthways, blanched for 1 minute) 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Combine lemon zest and juice, oil, garlic, salt and pepper into a bowl and turn the carrots in this to coat. Leave while you preheat the griddle or barbecue. Cook the carrots on the griddle or barbecue (reserving the dressing) turning them every few minutes until they are just tender to the point of a sharp knife. Transfer to a plate, pour over a little more dressing and add the parsley.
