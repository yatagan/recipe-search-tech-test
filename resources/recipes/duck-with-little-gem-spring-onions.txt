Duck with Little Gem, spring onions and peas
Introduction:
A dish for a summer's day. The light spring vegetables offset the richness of the duck. Don't forget to save any excess duck fat for roasting potatoes or cooking Yorkshire pudding. 
Ingredients:
2 duck breasts 2cm piece fresh ginger, finely grated 1 bunch spring onions, sliced 2 Little Gem lettuces, shredded 200g fresh or frozen peas a few mint leaves 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Heat a medium heavy-based frying pan until very hot. Add the duck breasts, skin-side down, then reduce the heat and cook for about 6 minutes, until the skin is nicely browned. Turn over and cook for another 6 minutes, until the duck is cooked but still pink in the centre. Remove from the pan and leave to rest in a warm place. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan. Add the ginger and spring onions and cook for a few minutes, until softened. Add the lettuce and peas and cook gently for 5 minutes or until the lettuce has wilted and the peas are cooked. Stir in the mint leaves, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar, then season to taste. Slice the duck breasts and serve on top of the vegetables.
