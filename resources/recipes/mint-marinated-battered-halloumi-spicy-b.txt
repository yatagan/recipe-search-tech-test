Mint marinated and battered halloumi with spicy broad bean dip
Introduction:
This recipe for marinated, fried halloumi and broad bean dip is good as a vegetarian starter, or spin it out into a main course with slices of warm pitta and salad. It's is a lovely way to use up older, larger beans, but make sure you double pod them before puréeing if they are big. Let the flavours of marinated halloumi infuse for a couple of hours. 
Ingredients:
for the halloumi: 100ml plain yoghurt 1 tbsp fresh mint leaves, finely chopped 300g halloumi, cut into ½cm slices 2 tbsp plain flour for the dip: 500g broad beans, podded to give 300-350g beans 1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted in a dry frying pan for 30 seconds, then ground 1 tsp paprika 1 garlic clove, chopped 4 tbsp olive oil juice of 1 lemon, more to taste 1-2 chillies, finely chopped for the batter: 50g plain flour 50g cornflour 1 tsp baking powder 150ml sparkling or soda water oil for frying, e.g. sunflower
Method:
For the halloumi: Mix the yoghurt and mint, then toss in the halloumi to coat. Leave to marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours. Make the dip: Boil the broad beans for 4 minutes. Drain, refresh in cold water, drain again and peel off the skins. Put in a processor with the rest of the dip ingredients except the chilli. Blitz to a purée. Stir in the chilli. Add salt and more lemon to taste. Make the batter: Whisk all the ingredients until smooth. Heat a deep fat fryer filled with sunflower oil to 180°C (or you can carefully use a pan of oil: put oil 4cm deep in the pan and use a food thermometer to check the temperature). Put the flour in a dish, dip the halloumi in it, then dip in the batter. Fry for 3-4 minutes, turning halfway, until golden. Drain on kitchen paper. Serve with the dip.
