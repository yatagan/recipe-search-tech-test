Chicken and chorizo in Basque style
Introduction:
One pan cooking is always a joy and this one packs in all the flavour of the Basque region; olives, chorizo, paprika. It works a little like paella, with meat and rice cooking together in good stock. Nothing more is need for a hearty, spicy dinner. 
Ingredients:
1 medium chicken, jointed into 8 pieces 2 tbsp olive oil 1 large Spanish onion, thinly sliced 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1 small red chilli, seeded & finely sliced 1 tsp smoked sweet paprika 150g cooking chorizo, cut into 1cm slices 300g calasparra or arborio rice 200ml white wine 750ml chicken stock 2 tbsp black olives 1 jar of roasted red peppers, drained & rinsed 2 tbsp parsley, chopped grated zest of 1 orange salt & pepper
Method:
Using a large saut√© or, even better, a paella pan, fry the chicken pieces in olive oil until browned on both sides, then remove with a slotted spoon. Fry the onions and garlic with the chilli, paprika and chorizo in the remaining oil for a few minutes. Scatter the rice into the pan and turn to coat with oil - adding a drizzle more if need be. Return chicken pieces to the pan and pour in the wine. Cook over a medium heat until the wine has almost all been absorbed then pour over the chicken stock and fold in the olives and grilled red peppers - making sure that thighs and legs remain well covered during cooking. Bring to a simmer, season and cook over a very low heat for 30-40 minutes without further stirring until the chicken joints are fully cooked and the rice tender. Check seasoning and adjust if necessary then scatter with chopped parsley and grated orange zest immediately before serving with crisp salad leaves.
