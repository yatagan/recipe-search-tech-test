Pork cooked in milk
Introduction:
Cooking in milk is another way of ensuring the pork stays juicy. The richness of the milk is offset by the herbs and lemon and the potatoes are ... I can’t think of a suitable superlative.
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1.2kg leg of pork 30g butter 6 garlic cloves, peeled & halved small bunch fresh sage, chopped small bunch fresh thyme, chopped 750ml full-fat milk zest of 1 lemon, peeled in long slivers pinch nutmeg, grated 500g small potatoes, peeled & left whole salt & pepper
Method:
You’ll need a heavy casserole with a lid, big enough for the pork with enough space around it for the potatoes. Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas Mark 3. Place the casserole over a medium heat and add the oil. Add the pork and brown on all sides. Remove the pork and wipe the oil from the pan with a bit of kitchen paper. Don’t burn your fingers. On a medium heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic, sage, thyme and cook for a minute or until the garlic is just starting to turn golden brown. Return the pork to the pan and pour over the milk. Add the slivers of lemon zest and a grating of nutmeg. Season generously. Fit the potatoes around the pork so they are submerged in the milk. Cover with a piece of baking parchment and place the lid on top. Roast in the oven for 2 hours, or until the pork is very tender and milk reduced to a creamy sauce. The milk will almost certainly have curdled and browned a bit so remove the pork and potatoes and give the liquid a zap with a stick blender. Serve with a salad.
