Thai-style chicken salad
Introduction:
A good combination of delicate raw veg, strips of chicken, noodles and piquant Asian-flavoured dressing. This takes less than half an hour to make. You can either use a pointed (Napa) cabbage or a Savoy cabbage, depending on what you have in your veg box. If you're using Savoy, cut it very finely or it may have a bit too solid a crunch. 
Ingredients:
for the dressing: 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 2 garlic clove, finely chopped or crushed 1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated 2 tbsp soy sauce juice of 1 lime for the salad: 175g egg noodles 2 chicken breasts 1 tbsp olive oil Â½ small Savoy cabbage, very finely shredded 3 carrots, cut into thin batons 5 spring onions, finely sliced handful fresh coriander, chopped 2 tbsp water or extra oil, to serve
Method:
Make the dressing by combining all the ingredients in a bowl. Assemble the salad: Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions. Drain and rinse in cold water. Keep to one side. Brush the chicken with oil and cook until the juices run clear (15-20 minutes) either in a frying pan, oven or grill. Put the vegetables and drained noodles in a bowl . Slice the chicken while still warm and add to the veg, with the juices from the chicken. Add the fresh coriander and dressing and toss all the ingredients together. Add a little water or extra oil if the salad is too dry.
