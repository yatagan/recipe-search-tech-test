Celery with garlic and walnut sauce
Introduction:
This makes an excellent accompaniment to a dinner of fish goujons or cooked, shelled mussels fried in batter. You could substitute almonds or hazelnuts for the walnuts in the sauce, if you prefer. 
Ingredients:
1 head celery 60g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 3 slices stale bread 3 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with a little salt 100g walnuts 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Peel off the strings from the celery stalks, then cut the stalks into batons about 5cm long and 5mmâ€“1cm thick. Heat the butter and oil in a pan, add the celery, season well and stir. Cover tightly and cook over a low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until the celery is soft. Sprinkle with the parsley. Meanwhile, remove the crusts from the bread and soak it in water. Squeeze out the excess water and blitz the bread in a food processor with the other sauce ingredients until smooth. Serve the celery with the sauce.
