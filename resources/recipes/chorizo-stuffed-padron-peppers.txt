Chorizo stuffed Padrón peppers
Introduction:
These little treats grow on our farm in France. Common in Spain as a tapas bar staple, quickly fried and thrown with sea salt. They are generally mild but every so often the odd one packs a real punch, it adds a roulette-style risk to your snacking. Stuffed with some of our homemade chorizo these are the perfect partner to an ice cold beer.
Ingredients:
2 cooking chorizo sausage olive oil 200g Padrón peppers sea salt
Method:
Remove the skins from the chorizo and crumble the meat. Fry it in a little olive oil until cooked. Cut a slit in the side of each pepper and stuff them roughly with the cooked chorizo. Fry the peppers, in the fat that remained from cooking the chorizo, until lightly blistered by the heat. Season with a little sea salt and serve hot.
