Red cabbage with prunes and chestnuts
Introduction:
Tasty enough to be a main on its own, this braised cabbage is a German side traditionally eaten with roast goose. It also goes well with venison, pork chops and sausages. It's a convenient dish that's easily made and not at all damaged by being re-heated several times. To speed up cooking, start with pre-soaked prunes. 
Ingredients:
8 prunes 140ml red wine 560g chestnuts, peeled 225g onions, sliced 1 red cabbage 2 cooking apples 4 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
Method:
Soak prunes in wine for 4 hours, then stone and chop them. Bring chestnuts to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes, cool and peel the inner layer. Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut onions, shred the cabbage and slice the apples. Heat the oil, cook the onions until transparent, add the chestnuts, cabbage, prunes, wine and vinegar and bring to the boil. Cover, put in the oven for 45 minutes.
