Whole roasted red onions
Introduction:
These are particularly good with a roast and can be cooked in the oven at the same time. For vegetarians, spread on toast, top with slices of goat’s cheese or brie and grill for a tasty lunch/supper. 
Ingredients:
8 red onions, root left intact 25g butter 1 tbsp light brown sugar 2 tbsp vinegar – use balsamic, sherry or red, whatever you have to hand 100ml veg or chicken stock 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 5. Put the onions into a snug fitting baking dish. Melt the butter in a pan, mix in the sugar, vinegar and stock, and pour over the onions. Sprinkle over the thyme leaves and season. Cover with foil and roast for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for another 45 minutes or so, until the onions are coloured and sticky.
