Linguine with mushrooms and Parmesan
Introduction:
This is a delightfully light and simple weeknight pasta that's good for bringing out the taste of the mushrooms. You could add a whirl of cream or crème fraîche at the end for something richer. If you're vegetarian, leave out or substitute the Parmesan. Eat with sautéed greens or a salad. 
Ingredients:
250g linguine 2 tbsp olive oil 200g mushrooms, cleaned & chopped into quarters 2 garlic cloves, crushed handful fresh thyme leaves 100ml white wine 50g butter handful flat leaf parsley, chopped 50g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water add the linguine & cook until al dente according to the instructions on the pack. Whilst the linguine is cooking, in another pan heat the oil over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms, garlic and thyme & toss for about 1-2 minutes. Add the wine and salt to taste. Cover with a lid and simmer the mushrooms for about 5-7 minutes. When the pasta is cooked, drain and return it to the pan. Toss the linguine in the butter and parsley then add the mushroom mixture and stir through. Serve in bowls, sprinkled with the Parmesan. A green salad or some steamed green vegetables would be a good accompaniment.
