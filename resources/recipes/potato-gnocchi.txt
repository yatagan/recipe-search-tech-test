Potato gnocchi
Introduction:
Making your own gnocchi is far easier than you'd imagine. The secret for getting them super-light is to use as little flour as you need. These are good with butter, or with pesto, or tomato sauce, or any other kind of pasta sauce you fancy. Serve with salad, braised greens or grilled mushrooms. 
Ingredients:
8 large potatoes 100g Parmesan, grated 50g flour 3 eggs, beaten pinch nutmeg, grated 50g butter, melted salt & pepper
Method:
Bake the potatoes whole until tender. Scoop out the flesh and mash or pass through a sieve. Return the puree to a saucepan and add half of the Parmesan, flour, eggs, seasoning and nutmeg. Mix well, adding a little more flour if the mixture seems very wet (it will depend on the water content of the potato). Cool the mixture. Make into little balls by rolling and shaping them on a floured board. Put them, a dozen at a time, into salted water at a rolling boil (not too fierce) for a few minutes, until they rise and are firm. Place in a dish and keep warm in the oven until they are all cooked, then pour over the melted butter and sprinkle with the rest of the Parmesan.
