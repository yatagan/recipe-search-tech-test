Roast belly of pork
Introduction:
A decent slab of roast belly pork is hard to beat. It’s great value, tender, tasty and rich. This recipe is a Chinese take on traditional roast pork and will bring warmth and spice to a Sunday roast. It involves a little preparation the day before, but after that all that is required on the day is to put the joint in the oven. 
Ingredients:
690g pork belly joint 1 tbsp five spice 1 tbsp sugar 1 tbsp salt 1 tbsp Sichuan pepper
Method:
Rub the belly of pork with the five spice, sugar, salt and Sichuan pepper and leave overnight in the fridge for the flavours to mingle and develop. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Blast the joint for 30 minutes, then slowly roast for a couple of hours at 150°C/Gas 2. Finally, turn up the oven to the maximum temperature for the final 10 minutes of cooking to crisp up the skin. Serve with Chinese greens, oyster sauce and rice.
