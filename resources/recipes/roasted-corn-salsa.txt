Roasted corn salsa
Introduction:
Sweet, crunchy corn, fresh tomatoes and coriander, creamy avocado, lime juice and a little heat from the chillies. This delicious vegetarian dish works as a topping to flatbreads, a filling for burritos, with thin slices of steak or with thin strips of griddled aubergine and halloumi slices. Add a half a finely diced red onion if you have one, and adjust the chilli content to your liking.

2 sweetcorn cobs 3 tbsp olive oil 4 tomatoes, deseeded & diced 2 avocados, peeled & diced 2 fresh chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2 tbsp fresh coriander, roughly chopped 4 tbsp lime juice good pinch of salt
