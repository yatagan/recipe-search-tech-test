Chicken, leek and corn soup
Introduction:
This is a comforting, easy main-meal soup that's made in less than half an hour. There's no need to be too exact with the quantities: if you have some leftover cooked chicken, you could just use that. This also stands up well as a vegetarian corn chowder if you leave out the chicken and bacon. 
Ingredients:
2 corn cobs 50g butter 2 red chillies, deseeded & diced 2 streaky bacon rashers, diced 1 onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 2 leeks, halved & sliced 2 floury potatoes, peeled & diced meat from 4 chicken thighs, skinned & diced 1 litre chicken stock 200ml single cream 1 tbsp chives or parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the kernels from the sweetcorn cobs – the easiest way to do this is to stand each cob upright on a board and cut downwards with a sharp knife in a sawing action. Heat the butter in a large pan, add the chillies, bacon, onion, garlic and leeks and fry for about 10 minutes, without browning. Add the potatoes, chicken, corn and stock and simmer for 15–20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the chicken is cooked. Stir in the cream and herbs, season well and serve.
