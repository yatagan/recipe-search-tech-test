The original captain’s chicken curry
Introduction:
Delicious midweek meal - serve with rice. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp vegetable oil 1 large onion, finely sliced ½ chicken - jointed but on the bone, (leg in 2, breast in 3), without skin 200g captain’s curry masala paste 500ml water 1 tsp salt 1 tsp paprika 1 tbsp cider vinegar
Method:
Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onion on a medium heat until nutbrown; about 15 minutes. Add the chicken pieces, sear on all sides, then add the paste and sauté for another 5 minutes, stirring all the while. Add two tablespoons of the water to make sure the masala does not stick to the pan. Remove the breast pieces (they cook faster). Now pour in the rest of the water, along with the salt and paprika, cover and simmer on a low heat for 10 minutes. Return breast pieces and cook gently for another 30 minutes. Add the vinegar, cook for 3 minutes more, then taste, adjusting as necessary for salt, vinegar and consistency of sauce.
