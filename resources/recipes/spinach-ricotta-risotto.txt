Spinach, ricotta and pine nut risotto
Introduction:
This is a delectable and simple vegetarian risotto which is easily adapted. If you've not got enough spinach in your box, add in some Swiss chard, or substitute chard for the spinach completely – you'll need to cut off the tough stalk ends. For a greener hue, purée half the spinach before adding it to the rice. Switch the ricotta for creamy Gorgonzola for a more pungent finish. 
Ingredients:
200g spinach 100g butter 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 150g risotto rice 150ml dry white wine 600ml hot veg stock 100g ricotta cheese 25g Parmesan, finely grated 50g pine nuts, toasted salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the spinach for 2 minutes. Drain and refresh in cold water, then drain again and chop finely. Melt half the butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a large, heavy pan and fry the onion on a low heat for 8 minutes until soft and transparent, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the rice and stir for 2 minutes until translucent. Turn up the heat and add the wine. Stir until absorbed, then gradually add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring constantly until the rice has absorbed enough liquid to be soft but still with some bite (about 20-25 minutes). Remove from the heat and stir in the chopped spinach, the rest of the butter, ricotta, Parmesan and pine nuts. Leave to stand for a minute or two. Season and serve.
