Leeks and eggs on toast
Introduction:
This is a quick lunch and nod to a classic leeks vinaigrette. A chopped anchovy and blob of mayo in the egg would make things a bit more indulgent. 
Ingredients:
1 large leek, trimmed & sliced 1 lemon 2 eggs, hard boiled & cooled handful of parsley, finely chopped 2 tsp capers, roughly chopped 2 small cornichons, finely diced celery salt 2 slices of good bread
Method:
Cook the leeks gently in a little butter or oil for 10-12 minutes until soft and silken. Season with a little salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon. Peel the eggs and roughly chop or grate them. Mix them with the parsley, capers and cornichons. Season with black pepper and a little celery salt, or sea salt if not. Toast the bread, pile on the warm leeks and top with the herby egg.
