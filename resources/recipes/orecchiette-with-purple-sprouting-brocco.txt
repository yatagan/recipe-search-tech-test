Orecchiette with purple sprouting broccoli, anchovy and cream
Introduction:
You can rustle up the sauce in the time it takes the pasta to cook, making this flavourful recipe a great one for a busy evening. If you don't like anchovies, substitute capers for saltiness. This recipe also works well with red Russian kale and cavolo nero. 
Ingredients:
400g purple sprouting broccoli, stalks trimmed & good leaves attached 3 garlic cloves, finely sliced 1 red chilli, chopped 1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 5-6 anchovy fillets 150ml cream 400g orecchiette or any other type of pasta 1 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch the purple sprouting broccoli in boiling salted water for 2 minutes. Drain, refresh in cold water and chop roughly. Cook the garlic, chilli and rosemary gently in the oil for a few minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the anchovies. Keep stirring until they have 'melted' into the oil. Add the purple sprouting broccoli and cook for a few minutes. Add the cream, bring to the boil and simmer for 5 minutes until the broccoli is cooked and the cream has reduced slightly. Season well. Cook the pasta, drain, then mix with the purple sprouting broccoli sauce. Adjust the seasoning and sprinkle with Parmesan to serve.
