Introduction:
This Morrocan aubergine and tomato dish is good as a starter, a dip with pitta or flatbread, or spread in a sandwich. To peel the tomatoes, cut a small cross in one end, lower into a bowl of boiling water for a minute, remove, plunge into cold water, then peel off the skins. If you don’t have any harissa, use a teaspoon each of paprika, ground cumin and coriander with a crumbled dried red chilli instead. 
Ingredients:
1 very large aubergine, or 2 smaller aubergines (500-600g) 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra 2 large or 3 smaller garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 5 tomatoes, peeled, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tsp caster sugar 1-2 tsp harissa (add to taste) handful fresh parsley, chopped handful fresh coriander, chopped juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the aubergine in half lengthways and cut criss-cross slashes into the flesh. Drizzle over a little olive oil and roast in the oven until tender (about 30-40 minutes). Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute (don’t let it burn). Add the tomatoes, sugar, harissa and ¾ of the herbs. Cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, until the mixture is a thick sauce. Scoop out the aubergine flesh and lightly mash it with a fork. Stir in the lemon juice and aubergine and season. Simmer for 5 minutes, then leave to cool and serve at room temperature, scattered with the rest of the herbs.
