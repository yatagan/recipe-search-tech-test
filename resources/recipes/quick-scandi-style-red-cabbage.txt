Scandi-style red cabbage
Introduction:
Many red cabbage recipes take a good couple of hours to cook. This Scandinavian-inspired recipe has lots of warm spicy flavour but takes less than half the time so it's quick enough for midweek cooking. Serve it alongside cold meats and rye bread, or with pork chops and creamy mashed potatoes. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp rapeseed or sunflower oil 1 red onion, very thinly sliced ½ large red cabbage, tough core & ribs removed, leaves finely shredded 3 juniper berries, bashed with the lat of your knife ½ tsp allspice ½ tsp caraway seeds 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 100ml red wine 2 tbsp cranberry sauce 1 good sized eating apple, cored & thinly sliced (no need to peel it)
Method:
Heat the oil in a large wide frying pan, wok or casserole, one with a lid (or you can cover the cabbage with a layer of foil instead). Add the onion and cabbage and fry for 10 minutes on a low to medium heat, stirring now and then. Add the juniper, allspice, caraway, bay leaf, vinegar, wine and cranberry sauce. Season, cover and cook on a low heat for 20 minutes. Add the apple and cook for a further 20 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Check the seasoning before serving.
