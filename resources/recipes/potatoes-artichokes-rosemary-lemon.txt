Roast new potatoes & artichokes with rosemary & lemon
Introduction:
This dish would be simplicity itself if it weren’t for the need to trim and prep the artichokes. We occasionally sell baby artichokes, which are easier to prepare as the immature chokes don’t need to be removed from the centres. Artichokes and potatoes have complementary earthy flavours. You’ll need to start the potatoes a little earlier to ensure they both finish cooking at the same time.
Ingredients:
3 large or 10 baby globe artichokes, prepared (see cook’s note) 500g new potatoes, halved or quartered olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 lemon, zested 2 rosemary sprigs, leaves roughly chopped
Method:
Preheat an oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Put the potatoes into a pan of cold water. Season generously with salt and bring to a boil. Cook for 8 minutes, until partly cooked. While the potatoes cook, put a roasting tray in the oven to warm up. When they’re ready, drain the potatoes and transfer to the hot roasting tray. Season and oil them well. Roast for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, add the artichokes to the roasting tray. Add a little more oil and seasoning. Mix well and return to the oven for about 20 minutes, turning once or twice, until both the potatoes and artichokes are coloured and tender. When the potatoes and artichokes are ready, mix the garlic, lemon zest and rosemary to the tray. Return to the oven and turn off the heat. Leave for 5 minutes to let the residual heat of the oven cook the garlic and herbs. Serve with wedges of remaining lemon, a good mayonnaise and a cold glass of white wine.
