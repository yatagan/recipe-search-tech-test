Zesty greens and turnips
Introduction:
This veggie side teams well with most meat and fish, or serve it with some grilled halloumi for vegetarians. Use whatever greens you get in your veg box. If it's summer greens or cabbage, wilt them in the pan with the turnips. If it's spinach or chard, it's best to strip off the stalks and blanch the leaves in boiling water first, to avoid any excess liquid in your dish. Boil for 1 minute for spinach, 2 for chard, then refresh in cold water, drain, squeeze out any excess moisture and roughly chop the leaves before adding to the dish just to warm through before serving. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, crushed 4 turnips, peeled & finely sliced finely grated zest of 1 & juice of ½ lemon 350g greens – use spring, summer greens or cabbage, finely shredded olive oil, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
In a large frying pan or saucepan, heat the oil and add the garlic and turnips. Fry on a medium heat for about 4-5 minutes, then add the lemon zest and greens. Fry for another 3-4 minutes, until the greens have just wilted. Add a good squeeze of lemon juice to taste and season well with salt and pepper. Drizzle with a little olive oil to serve.
