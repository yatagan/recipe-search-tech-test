This easy summer pasta recipe can be run up in under fifteen minutes – a good light lunch or dinner for a busy weeknight. Add in any other light summer greens you like – broccoli, asparagus, courgette and French or green beans. Meat lovers might like a scattering of chopped ham or bacon. 
Ingredients:
400g dried pasta 2 tbsp olive oil 3-4 handfuls sugar snap peas, topped & tailed & finely sliced 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 3-4 tbsp crème fraîche zest of 1 lemon & a squeeze of the juice 4 tbsp Parmesan, grated* handful basil leaves, torn salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta while you make the sauce. Warm the oil in a large pan and add the sliced peas and chopped garlic. Stir fry for a couple of minutes until the peas are al dente and the garlic just colouring. Add the cream and lemon zest and cook together a minute or two more until the sauce is bubbling. Add half the Parmesan, the basil, a few drops of lemon juice, plenty of pepper and salt to taste. Mix the sauce into the drained pasta and serve with the remaining Parmesan.
