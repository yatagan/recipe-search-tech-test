Chargrilled courgettes with basil
Introduction:
One of our favourite ways to cook courgettes; they look lovely and have a beautiful, slightly smoky taste. Try mixing with some white beans and halved cherry tomatoes, or with asparagus, cherry tomatoes and halloumi, or serve as a side dish with chicken. This works best with a ridged griddle pan or barbecue, and ideally some tongs. If you don’t have any basil, use some roughly chopped mint instead, or some grated lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice.
Ingredients:
4 courgettes 2 tbsp olive oil & extra for dressing 1 red chilli, deseeded & chopped or a pinch of chilli flakes (optional) a handful of basil ½ garlic clove salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the courgettes lengthways into strips about 3-4mm thick. Toss in the oil, season well, add the chilli if using, then cook in batches on a ridged griddle pan, turning when one side has charred slightly. Try not to move the courgettes as they are cooking; they will have cooked plenty by the time you have marks on both sides. Remove to a serving bowl. You can either serve just with the basil torn over, or blitz the basil and garlic with enough oil to make a dressing in a food processor or blender.
