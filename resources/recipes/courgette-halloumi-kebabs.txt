Courgette and halloumi kebabs
Introduction:
These vegetarian kebabs are easy to put together and filled with smoky salty flavour, especially if you grill them on the barbecue. If you've got red peppers in your box, add them too. Serve drizzled over with the yoghurt and tahini dressing. This goes beautifully with lemony couscous sprinkled with toasted flaked almonds or chopped pistachios. 
Ingredients:
bamboo kebab sticks for the dressing: 2 tbsp light tahini (sesame paste) 2 tbsp yoghurt 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp olive oil juice of 1 lemon, more to taste handful coriander leaves, finely chopped handful mint leaves, finely chopped salt & pepper for the kebabs: 2 packs High Weald halloumi, cut into large cubes 3 large courgettes, chopped into large bite-sized pieces 2 green chillies, deseeded & finely chopped oil for frying e.g.vegetable
Method:
Soak the skewers in a bowl of cold water for 20 minutes. Make the dressing: Stir the tahini with the yoghurt to make a smooth paste. Whisk in the garlic, olive oil and lemon juice with a few tablespoons of water, just enough to get the consistency of pouring cream. Stir in the chopped herbs. Season and add more lemon juice to taste. Construct the kebabs: Thread the courgettes and halloumi pieces onto the skewers. Mix the chillies with 4 tablespoons of oil. Brush a little over the kebabs. Heat a griddle, non-stick frying pan or BBQ. Fry the kebabs, brushing with more oil and chilli and turning carefully every few minutes, until the courgettes and halloumi are golden. Remove from the heat and drizzle over the dressing to serve.
