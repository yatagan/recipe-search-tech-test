Damson fool
Introduction:
Our damsons are grown in Joe Pardoe’s organic orchards in Herefordshire. This cultivated variety is sweeter than its wild cousins, but they will still have a good sharpness to them. The sugar in this recipe is enough to balance this, but keeps some of the tartness that is key to their charm. If you still find them too sharp or sour, cook a little more sugar into them before sieving. 
Ingredients:
400g damsons 100ml water 50g light muscovado sugar 300ml double cream 25g icing sugar
Method:
Wash the damsons and place them in a saucepan with the water and the muscovado sugar. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the fruit is soft. Pass the damsons through a sieve into a clean bowl. Use a spatula to help pass as much of the pulp through as possible. You want to trap the stones and the worst of the skins in the sieve. Pop the damson purée into the fridge to chill. When the damson purée is cold, whisk the cream and icing sugar together until it forms soft peaks. Fold and ripple the damson purée through the cream. Serve immediately, ideally with shortbread.
