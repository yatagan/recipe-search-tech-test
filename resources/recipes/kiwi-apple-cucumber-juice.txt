Kiwi, apple & cucumber juice
Introduction:
Some juicers don’t like dealing with the skin of a kiwi. They can carry a mildly ‘furry’ taste with them, too. They are easily dispatched with a peeler or sharp knife. This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order to plunge. 
Ingredients:
2 kiwis, skinned 2 apples ½ cucumber
