Chickpeas with carrots and Swiss chard
Introduction:
A easy, quick and healthy weeknight dinner. If you use tinned rather than dried chickpeas this can be on the table in half and hour. Although this is a standalone vegetarian meal, it's also good with fish or lamb, or as part of a mezze. 
Ingredients:
150g dried chickpeas, soaked in cold water overnight & then drained 1 head of garlic, sliced horizontally in half 3 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 400g carrots, cut into 1cm dice 3 tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & chopped (or use tinned tomatoes) 2 tsp tomato purée 400g Swiss chard 1 tbsp finely chopped mint salt & pepper
Method:
Place the drained chickpeas in a saucepan and cover with fresh water. Add the halved garlic head, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour and 25 minutes until tender. Top up with more water if necessary. When the chickpeas are done, drain, season well and dress with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Set aside. Heat the remaining oil in a shallow pan, add the onion and cook gently for about 15 minutes, until very soft. Add the chopped garlic and the carrots and cook slowly for 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato purée, turn up the heat and cook for 5 minutes or until the tomato mixture has reduced enough to coat the carrots. Strip the leaves off the stalks of chard, discarding the stalks. Add the chard leaves and chickpeas to the pan and cook until the chard has wilted. Stir in the chopped mint, toss together and dress with a little good olive oil. Adjust the seasoning and serve with warm crusty bread.
