Iced cucumber and yoghurt soup
Introduction:
This cool, vegetarian soup is prepared in ten minutes and is a beautifully refreshing starter. Ideally you should make it well in advance so the flavours can deepen – but as long as it has time to chill it will be fine. 
Ingredients:
1 large or 3 mini cucumbers, peeled if skin is tough 500ml Greek or other full fat plain yoghurt 1 bunch dill, chopped 10 mint leaves, chopped (optional – or use more mint & no dill) 1 garlic clove, finely minced 1 tsp caster sugar 2 tbsp olive oil water & ice cubes to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Dice cucumber finely (about ½cm dice). Combine yoghurt, dill, mint (if using), garlic, sugar and olive oil. Mix well and add the cucumber. Leave to marinade for 1 hour if possible. When ready to serve, thin with cold water to the consistency of thick cream. Taste and season well. Pour into soup bowls and add a few ice cubes to each. Serve with the garlic and olive oil toast, or on its own.
