Spiced celeriac with lemon
Introduction:
The taste of celeriac is often concealed behind cream and butter, but here the Middle Eastern spices bring it out nicely. This goes well for dinner with chicken, lamb steaks or fish. 
Ingredients:
1 large or 2 small celeriac 3 tbsp olive oil pinch smoked paprika pinch cayenne pepper pinch ground cinnamon grated zest of 1 & juice of 1½ lemons salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the celeriac, cut into slices 5mm–1cm thick, then cut the slices into long, thin sticks. Heat the oil in a large pan, add the celeriac sticks and fry for about 15 minutes until slightly browned. At this point sprinkle with the spices, lemon zest and juice and 100ml water. Simmer for about 10 minutes until the celeriac is just tender. Season to taste, adding more lemon juice if necessary.
