Potato and parsley soup
Introduction:
The parsley really livens up this simple soup. Double the quantity if you want a more peppery kick, and use flat-leaf if you can, rather than curly – it tastes a bit stronger. Adding half the parsley at the end ensures it has a fresh green colour. You could vary this by adding a little chilli to spice it up (add with the potatoes), or some fresh cooked crab meat or buttery fried mushrooms stirred in when you reheat to serve. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large or 2 small onions, sliced 750g potatoes, peeled & diced 2 celery sticks, diced (optional) 40g parsley, use the stalks & leaves 1.2 litres chicken or veg stock crème fraîche or double cream, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then add the onions and fry on a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring every now and again, until soft (do not allow to burn). Add the potatoes, celery and half the parsley. Add the stock, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the potatoes are soft. Add the rest of the parsley and blitz in a food processor (in batches if necessary). Add a little more stock or water to thin if needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then reheat gently. Add a swirl (or dollop!) of crème fraîche or double cream to serve.
