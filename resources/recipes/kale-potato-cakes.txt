Kale and potato cakes
Introduction:
Crunchy, green-flecked fried potato cakes. It you've got leftover mash to start with, this comforting winter dish can be whipped up in no time. There's no need to be too exact with your veg – any green would work here, including shredded Brussels sprouts. Try this with eggs at breakfast or sausages at dinner. 
Ingredients:
500g baking or floury potatoes, peeled & diced 50g butter 200g trimmed leeks, finely shredded 75g curly kale, finely shredded 2 tsp caraway seeds 1 tsp paprika 3 tsp wholegrain mustard 2 egg yolks 2 tbsp crème fraîche 100g smoked Cheddar, thinly sliced salt & pepper
Method:
Put the potatoes in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Cook until tender (about 12-15 minutes). Drain and put back in the pan to dry out slightly. Mash or put through a potato ricer. Melt half the butter in a large frying pan and add the leek and kale. Fry, stirring, for a few minutes to soften. Add the spices and cook for a further 2 minutes. Mix the mashed potato, leeks and kale, mustard, egg yolks and crème fraîche in a large bowl. Season. Shape into 4 large or 8 small burger shaped patties. Heat the rest of the butter in a large non-stick frying pan and gently cook the potato cakes on both sides until dark golden and crispy. Top the cakes with the cheese and place under a hot grill until melting.
