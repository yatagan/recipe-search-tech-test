Squash and herby harissa dip
Introduction:
Roasting squash brings out its lovely, caramel sweetness. Set off with fiery harissa, cool yoghurt, fresh herbs and crunch pumpkin seeds, this is good as a starter, part of a mezze spread, or a light vegetarian meal. Eat with warm pitta or flatbreads. 
Ingredients:
700-800g squash, peeled & diced juice of 1 lemon olive oil 1 tsp herby harissa, more if you like it very hot (or use another variety) 3 tbsp plain yoghurt small handful fresh coriander, chopped small handful fresh mint, chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Put the squash in a baking dish and toss in just enough olive oil to coat. Roast for 35 minutes or so, until tender. Mash coarsely with a potato masher. Stir in the harissa and just enough lemon juice, olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Always taste as you add the harissa, as they vary in heat. Mix the yoghurt with the chopped herbs and garlic. Transfer the squash to a serving dish and swirl the yoghurt through. Drizzle with a little more oil and scatter over the toasted pumpkin seeds.
