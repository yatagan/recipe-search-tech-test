Griddled new potatoes with mint, lemon and rapeseed dressing
Introduction:
Warm, lightly dressed waxy new potatoes redolent of spring. If you don’t have a griddle pan, use a heavy-based frying pan. These potatoes are good with chops, with fish, or at a barbecue. 
Ingredients:
800g new potatoes, scrubbed & cut into ½ lengthways rapeseed oil finely grated zest of ½ & juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp mint, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes for 4 minutes. Drain, then toss in just enough oil to coat. Heat a griddle pan on a medium high heat. Griddle each side until browned and tender all the way through, about 4-5 minutes. Cook in batches if needed and keep warm in the oven. Whisk the lemon zest and juice, mint and 3 tablespoons of oil in small bowl and season. Toss the warm potatoes in the dressing to serve.
