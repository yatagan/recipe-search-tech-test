Chilled spinach, yoghurt and mint soup
Introduction:
This is a lovely, fresh vegetarian soup for the hot summer months, with the earthines of spinach set off by sharp mint and tangy yoghurt. For a slightly different take, if you have chard in your veg box use that instead or as well as spinach, removing the tough white stems. 
Ingredients:
250g spinach, stalks removed 1 garlic clove, chopped 500g plain yoghurt 3 tsp dried mint 200-300ml chilled veg stock a few fresh mint leaves, shredded fresh nutmeg, grated, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
In a pan of boiling water, cook the spinach or chard leaves for 2 minutes, until just wilted. Drain and immediately refresh in a bowl of very cold water. Drain again, then squeeze any excess moisture from the leaves with your hands. Place in a food processor with the garlic, yoghurt and dried mint. Blitz, gradually adding enough stock until the soup is smooth and has your preferred consistency. Season well. Transfer to a bowl and chill for an hour or two. Serve sprinkled with the fresh mint leaves and a little grated nutmeg.
