Cheesy bean cottage pie
Introduction:
Rich, aromatic meat and beans topped with fluffy mash. A tin of baked beans is a good, easy way of making a cottage pie go a little further. It should be one that the kids will like. Eat with savoy cabbage or kale, or chilli and herb crushed swede and carrot. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion, finely chopped 450g minced beef 1 tbsp tomato puree splash of Worcestershire sauce 1 tsp dried thyme 150ml water 400g tin baked beans 1kg potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped 50g butter splash of milk 50g Cheddar cheese, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the onion. Gently fry for about 8-10 minutes, until translucent. Turn up the heat, add the mince and brown all over. Add the tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce, thyme and water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the beans, stir to combine and season. Transfer to a baking dish. While cooking the mince, cook the potatoes in a large pan of salted boiling water until they are just soft (about 8 minutes). Drain, then mash with the butter and a splash of milk. Season to taste and spread over the mince, using a fork to fluff up the mash. Sprinkle over the cheese and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, until the cheese has melted and turned golden, and the mash is starting to crisp on top.
