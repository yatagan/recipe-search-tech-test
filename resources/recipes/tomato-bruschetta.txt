Tomato bruschetta
Introduction:
The absolute requirements for this easy recipe are perfectly ripe, juicy tomatoes and good, crusty bread. Bruschetta makes a tasty canapé or a light summer lunch. If you’d like broader range of flavour, add anchovies, capers or olives for saltiness. Slices of mozzarella are another good addition. 
Ingredients:
2 slices sourdough bread or ciabatta 1 garlic clove olive oil 10 cherry tomatoes, diced ½ red onion, finely sliced 6 basil leaves, shredded balsamic vinegar, to drizzle salt & pepper
Method:
Grill the ciabatta or sourdough bread on both sides. Rub one side with a peeled clove of garlic and drizzle with olive oil. Top with cherry tomatoes, red onion, basil, a little crushed garlic and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.
