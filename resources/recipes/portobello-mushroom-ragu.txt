Portobello mushroom ragù & spaghetti
Introduction:
This is a vegan take on a traditional Italian ragù. The earthy portobello mushrooms add depth and a wonderful savoury flavour. This sauce can also be used in other recipes, like a lentil and mushroom pie, or stuffed roasted squash. 
Ingredients:
1 onion 1 carrot 1 celery stick oil for frying 200g portobello mushrooms 1 tin dark lentils 1 garlic clove 1 good tbsp thyme leaves, plus a little extra to garnish salt & pepper 1 tsp dried oregano 100ml red wine 1 tbsp Worcester sauce 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 tsp bouillon powder ½ tin chopped tomatoes 200g spelt spaghetti
Method:
Put a medium saucepan of salted water on to boil. Peel and finely dice the onion. Peel and finely dice the carrot. Trim and finely dice the celery. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large saucepan. Fry the onion, carrot and celery on a low heat for 15 mins, until they’re starting to soften, without colouring. Stir now and then and add a splash of water if they look like catching. Slice the mushrooms (approx. 1cm). Drain and rinse the lentils. They clump together in the tin but will separate. Peel and chop the garlic. Strip off 1 good tbsp of thyme leaves. Add the mushrooms to the carrot and celery pan. Season. Increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for approx. 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the mushrooms have softened. Stir the garlic, thyme, oregano and wine into the mushrooms. Cook for approx. 2-3 mins, stirring now and then, until the wine has reduced by ½. Add the Worcester sauce, tomato purée, bouillon powder, lentils, and ½ tin of tomatoes to the mushroom pan. Bring to a simmer. Cook over a medium heat while you boil the pasta for 6-7 mins. Stir the ragù frequently and add a splash of water if it starts getting too thick, particularly towards the end. When the spaghetti is just tender, drain it. Check the ragù seasoning. Divide the spaghetti and ragù between 2 bowls, sprinkled with a few extra freshly picked thyme leaves.
