Celeriac Crisps
Introduction:
This method of cooking celeriac concentrates its flavour beautifully. It could also be tried with parsnips, carrots and beetroot. Don't fill the pan more than half full with oil to ensure there's no up-splash. 
Ingredients:
celeriac, peeled sunflower or vegetable oil salt
Method:
Deep-fry celeriac shavings (made using a vegetable peeler) in sunflower oil, then drain well and sprinkle with salt for an alternative crisp.
