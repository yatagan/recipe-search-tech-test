Easy ideas for turnips
Introduction:
If they're eaten fresh and cooked in the right way there's no need at all for your turnip to languish at the bottom of your veg box. 
Ingredients:
Turnips
Method:
Boil or steam peeled chopped turnips, then mash them with butter and seasoning. Pass through a mouli-légumes or blitz in a food processor until smooth. Turnip leaves are fantastic to eat if they are in good condition. Blanch them briefly and then braise in a little oil with anchovy and chilli. Alternatively, shred the leaves and add them to braised turnips: Put 600g turnips, 50g butter, 1 tablespoon honey and 50 ml water in a heavy-based pan and place over a high heat until the mixture is simmering away. Turn the heat right down, cover the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, frequently checking and stirring the turnips to make sure they don’t stick and burn. When the turnips are almost cooked, uncover the pan, increase the heat slightly and stir in 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and the turnip leaves. Cook for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat and stir in some chopped parsley.
