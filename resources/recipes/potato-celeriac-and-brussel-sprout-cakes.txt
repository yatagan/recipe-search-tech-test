Potato, celeriac and Brussels sprout cakes
Introduction:
This simple, vegetarian recipe takes advantage of all the winter vegetables about at the same time. The combination and ingredients need not be exact: try cabbage, leeks or kale instead or sprouts; and although celeriac and potato is a particularly good combination, you could just use one or the other. This makes a warming, child-friendly dinner with fried sausages. 
Ingredients:
225g potatoes, cooked & mashed 225g celeriac, cooked & mashed 25g flour 1 egg, beaten 225g sprouts, finely chopped butter and oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the potato and celeriac together and sift in most of the flour. Season and stir in the egg and finally the sprouts. Form into little cakes and dust with the remaining flour. Heat enough butter to cover the bottom of the pan and when it is very hot, add the cakes. Turn down the heat and cook for 10 minutes, turn and then repeat. These are great served with fried sausages.
