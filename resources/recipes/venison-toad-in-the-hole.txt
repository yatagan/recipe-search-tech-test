Venison toad in the hole
Introduction:
Before everyone settled on pork sausages, toad in the hole used to be made with any meat that was to hand – it works beautifully with the richer taste of venison sausages. Eat with rich, sticky onion gravy, roasted carrots and seasonal greens. 
Ingredients:
6 venison sausages oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower for the gravy: 1 tbsp oil 2 onions, finely sliced 1 tsp dark brown sugar 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tsp plain flour 250ml veg stock for the Yorkshire pudding batter: 300ml whole milk 75ml water 3 eggs 225g plain flour 1 tsp sea salt
Method:
Make the gravy: Heat the oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onions and sugar and stir well. Gently cook on a very low heat for 45 minutes – 1 hour, until the onions are very soft and caramelised. Add the vinegar, cook for 1 minute. Add the flour and stir for 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer to thicken slightly. Turn off the heat and leave until needed; it can be reheated to serve. Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Make the batter: Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and whisk well to combine. Leave to stand. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a non-stick flame and ovenproof non-stick roasting tin. Add the sausages and fry to brown on all sides. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons more oil to the tin and turn the heat to 220°C/Gas 7. Bake for another 5 minutes. Pour in the batter. Cook for 25 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and puffed up. Don’t open the oven door to look at the batter while it’s cooking or it will sink. Serve with the onion gravy.
