Sprouts with chestnuts and bacon
Introduction:
Brussels sprouts get a bad press, but combining them with crispy bacon lardons and sweet chestnuts is a revelation in flavour. This is a good side dish or garnish to pork, game or the traditional turkey. 
Ingredients:
500g Brussels sprouts, trimmed 80g chestnuts 80g bacon lardons
Method:
Boil the sprouts until they are how you like them. Roast the chestnuts with the skins on and leave until skins go black. When the chestnuts are cool, peel them and pop in a pan with some lardons and the sprouts, mix together well and serve when bacon is cooked.
