Quick strawberry ice cream
Introduction:
This ice cream captures the taste of summer – but only if you use very good, very ripe strawberries. The addition of alcohol helps the freezing process and here we use a little red wine. If you'd like a lighter version, swap the cream for more yoghurt. Then you can eat it for breakfast as well as dessert. 
Ingredients:
500g strawberries 1 tbsp orange juice 2 tbsp honey 50ml red wine 200ml double cream 150g plain yoghurt
Method:
Whizz the strawberries, orange juice, honey and red wine in a food processor, then strain through a fine sieve to remove the seeds. Whip the double cream and yoghurt together until they form soft peaks, then fold them into the strawberry purée. Freeze until firm. About 20 minutes before serving, transfer to the fridge to soften slightly.
