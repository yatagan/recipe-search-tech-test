Roasted crown prince soup
Introduction:
This easy-to-make, bold and warming soup is a great warming recipe for autumn. Crown prince squash have steely-blue skins, rich orange flesh and a sweet and nutty flavour. They can be pretty tough to peel – you might have to deploy a knife as well as a peeler. Serve with a swirl or cream or crème fraîche, and some bread to mop up. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 1 small crown prince squash, about 700g, peeled & diced 480g tomatoes, quartered 2-3 garlic cloves olive oil 2 chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2-3cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated about 1½ litre good veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Put the onion, squash, tomatoes and garlic in a roasting tin. Toss in enough oil to coat. Season. Roast for about 35-40 minutes or so, until the squash is tender. Transfer to a blender. Add the chillies and ginger. Blitz to a purée, adding a little stock, then reheat in a large pan, adding more stock to your desired consistency. Check the seasoning before serving.
