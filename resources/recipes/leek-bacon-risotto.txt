Leek and bacon risotto
Introduction:
A simple, undemanding dinner, this comforting risotto can easily by made for vegetarians without the bacon. A warm bowl of it is good on its own, or with a bitter leaf salad, or topped with a runny-yolked fried or poached egg. It works especially well with winter leeks, as their taste is strongest. And if you’ve got any leftover cooked chicken or a handful of mushrooms to throw in, that’s all to the good. 
Ingredients:
2 leeks, washed, trimmed & finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 150g Arborio rice 100ml white wine 700ml hot veg bouillon stock 25g butter 3 tbsp Parmesan, grated 4 rashers streaky bacon, diced & fried until crispy 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Gently sweat the leeks and garlic together in some olive oil until soft for around 10 minutes. Add the rice and cook for a further 2 minutes before adding the wine. Turn up the heat and let the liquid bubble until nearly disappeared. Now add the hot stock, a ladleful at a time; stir the rice until the stock has been absorbed before adding the next ladleful. It is ready when the rice is creamy and cooked with a slight bite. Beat in the butter and Parmesan to your taste. Stir in the bacon, season and tweak with a squeeze or two of lemon juice.
