Swineherd’s pie
Introduction:
This inexpensive, warming pie is a logical extension of cottage and shepherd's pie: veg and pork mince cooked with herbs and topped with buttery mash. Instead of the using straight potato for the topping, you could use half parsnip or celeriac, both of which go very well with pork, or a mixture of swede and potato. This is great with cabbage, braised greens or peas. 
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, peeled & diced 50g butter splash of milk or cream oil for frying, e.g. sunflower 400g pork mince 1 large leek, cut in ½ lengthways, finely shredded 2 carrots, peeled & finely diced 2 sticks of celery, finely diced either 1 tsp dried fennel seeds, or 4-5 shredded fresh sage leaves, or the leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme 1 apple, cored & cut into small dice 2 tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan. Add the pork and fry to brown all over, stirring to break up any large chunks. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add a splash more oil to the pan, along with the leek, carrot, celery and fennel seeds or herbs. Fry gently, stirring now and then to stop it catching, for about 8 minutes. Add the pork back to the pan and stir in the apple and mustard. Season with salt and pepper, just cover with water, and simmer until tender (about 40 minutes). Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a pan of water with a good pinch or two of salt. Bring to the boil. Cook for 12-15 minutes, until tender. Drain, leave to steam in the colander for a couple of minutes to dry out, then mash well with the butter and milk, and season generously. Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Scoop the pork filling into a baking dish, top with the mashed potato, and bake for half an hour until browning on top.
