Parsnip & leek curry with apple salad
Introduction:
Delicately spiced vegetable curry with parsnips, leeks and tomatoes, served alongside a crisp and refreshing apple salad and nutty brown basmati rice. Curry powder can vary in strength but, if you are cautious about chilli heat, try adding two-thirds to start. You can always add more later in the cooking process if you want. 
Ingredients:
100g brown basmati rice salt & pepper 1 leek oil for frying 1 large or 2 small parsnips 2 tomatoes ⅔ tin chickpeas 1 tbsp curry powder 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground ginger 1 tsp black mustard seeds 1 apple 15g mint 20g sultanas ½ tsp black onion seeds 150g low fat yogurt 1 lemon
Method:
Boil a kettle. Rinse the rice in a sieve. Put the rice in a saucepan. Cover with plenty of boiled water. Add a good pinch of salt. Cook on a low boil for approx. 20 mins, until the rice is tender with a little bite. Meanwhile, halve the leek, lengthways. Finely slice, then wash well to remove any grit. Heat ½ tbsp of oil in a saucepan. Gently fry the leek for 5 mins, stirring now and then, while you peel the parsnip(s) and chop into 2cm chunks. After 5 mins, transfer the leek to a plate. Heat ½ tbsp of oil in the same saucepan. Fry the parsnips for 3-4 mins until they take on a little colour. While the parsnips cook, roughly dice the tomatoes and drain the chickpeas (you just need ⅔ of the tin). Add the tomatoes, leek, chickpeas, curry powder, cumin, ground coriander, ground ginger and mustard seeds to the parsnips. Cook for 1 min then add 300ml of boiled water. Season. Simmer for 10-12 mins, until the parsnip is tender. Meanwhile, peel, core and roughly dice the apple. Finely slice the mint leaves. In a bowl, mix the apple, mint, sultanas, yogurt and the black onion seeds. Season with salt and a squeeze or two of lemon juice, to taste. When the curry is ready, taste and adjust the seasoning. Drain the rice and serve it alongside the curry and apple salad.
