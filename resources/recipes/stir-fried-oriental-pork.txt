Stir-fried Oriental pork
Introduction:
Aromatic and flavour-rich, this super quick pork and veggie stir-fry makes an ideal weeknight dinner. It's a flexible recipe and would also work well if you preferred chicken, beef or tofu in place of pork. Serve this over rice or noodles. 
Ingredients:
2 tsp sesame oil 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced 2 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated 500g pork, diced 5ml cornflour 200g mushrooms 125ml sake or sherry 3 tbsp soy sauce 50g fresh spinach
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok or heavy based frying pan. Add the garlic and ginger, and fry for 1 minute over a moderate heat until light golden brown and soft. Lightly toss pork pieces in the cornflour to coat and stir fry over a moderate heat for 4-5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, sake or sherry, soy sauce and spinach. Stir fry for a further 3-4 minutes until the meat is sealed. Serve over a bed of egg noodles.
