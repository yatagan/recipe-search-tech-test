Curried mince beef flatbreads
Introduction:
The recipe below calls for baking powder rather than yeast which gives the flatbreads a characteristic biscuity texture. 
Ingredients:
for the dough: 100ml olive oil 130ml water 400g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt for the filling: 1 medium onion 2-3 tbsp olive oil 2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced 150g captains curry paste (search for our recipe) 350g minced beef good bunch parsley, finely chopped
Method:
For the dough mix the oil and water together in a large bowl. Stir in the dry ingredients. Knead into a ball and wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for an hour. While the dough rests, prepare the filling. Chop and gently fry the onion in the oil for 10 minutes, until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and curry paste and cook for another minute or so. Increase the heat slightly and add the beef. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the meat is browned all over. Add the parsley, season well and leave to cool. Once the dough has rested and the filling is cool, prepare the flatbreads. Sprinkle some more flour on a work surface and divide the dough into six equal pieces. Roll one of the pieces out on the floured surface to a disc 20-25cm in diameter. Roll it as thinly as you can – until you can virtually see through it. Spread a sixth of the filling mixture over one half of the circle, leaving a border of about 1cm around the edges. Fold the other half of the circle over the top and pinch the edges together to seal. Dust with a little more flour and lightly roll until it’s stretched a bit more. It doesn’t matter if a bit of the filling bursts out. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan and fry the bread over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling. Best served hot with some sort of flavoured yogurt dip.
