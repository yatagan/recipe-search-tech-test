Cauliflower
Method:
Blanch cauliflower florets. Pour over some melted butter and toasted flaked almonds for a sophisticated side dish. For a quick salad blanch florets and while still warm pour over olive oil, salt and pepper, chopped capers and chopped flat leaf parsley. Break into florets and boil until just tender. Drain and return to the pan with very finely chopped onion, 6 finely chopped anchovies, 1 tablespoon of vinegar, a slug of olive oil and some chopped marjoram or oregano. Cover with a lid, cook for a few minutes and serve hot or cold. Boil florets until quite soft. Pur√©e and combine with double cream or creme fraiche, a little garlic and some grated nutmeg. Season and reheat. Great served with roast meats.
