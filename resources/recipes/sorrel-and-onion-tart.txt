Sorrel and onion tart
Introduction:
Sorrel's a refreshing, lemony, slightly sour green that cuts through this tart's creamy filling. It can be partly or completely replaced by spinach for a milder taste or out of season. This is such a popular vegetarian option in the Field Kitchen that we've had to plant another massive patch of sorrel. 
Ingredients:
for the shortcrust pastry: 175g plain flour 1 tsp caster sugar pinch salt 125g cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes about 3 tbsp cold water for the filling: 50g butter 1 large red onion, thinly sliced 150-200g sorrel 3 eggs 250ml crème fraîche 50ml milk 1 tbsp Pecorino, Parmesan or Gruyère cheese, grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. First make the pastry. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor and process briefly to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl and stir in enough water to make a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry, use to line a 24cm loose-bottomed tart tin and bake blind for 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 150°C/Gas 2. Make the filling: Melt the butter in a pan, add the onion and cook gently for 15 minutes, until soft. Cut off the stems from the sorrel and slice the leaves roughly. Add the sorrel to the onion and cook for about 2 minutes until they change to a khaki colour and the volume decreases. Whisk the eggs, crème fraîche and milk together with half the cheese and season well. Stir in the onion and sorrel. Pour the mixture into the prepared pastry case and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Place in the oven and bake for 35–40 minutes until the filling is set and slightly brown on top. Serve warm.
