roasted asparagus with spring onions & goat's cheese
Introduction:
We serve this dish as a starter in the Field Kitchen. It is simplicity itself and makes a perfect lunch with a few slices of chewy, crusty bread and butter. We use a goat's cheddar as it lends itself well to grating, crumbling or shaving, but a younger, fresher goat's cheese will still hit the mark. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch of asparagus olive oil 4–6 spring onions, depending on size 50g goat’s cheddar ½ lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oven to 210°C/Gas 7. Snap the tough lower stalks from the asparagus then split any larger stems in half lengthways so that they are all roughly the same size. Toss the asparagus in a baking dish in just enough oil to coat. Season with salt and pepper and roast in the oven for 8–12 minutes (depending on thickness) until just tender. Trim the spring onions; nip off the root, cut off the darker ends and peel away the first layer of skin. Slice very finely at an angle. Break up the slices with your fingertips. As soon as you take the asparagus out of the oven, squeeze the lemon juice over it and toss the spring onions through. Pile on to a plate and crumble, grate or shave the cheese on top.
