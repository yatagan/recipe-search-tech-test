Rhubarb and cardamom fool
Introduction:
Rhubarb and cardamom are a lovely match in this quick and easy dessert. If you'd like to make a healthier version, omit the cream and just use yoghurt. Tone down the sugar slightly and it'll definitely qualify as breakfast, with a handful of granola scattered on top – a very uplifting start to the day. 
Ingredients:
450g rhubarb, coarsely chopped 150g caster sugar grated zest & juice of 1 orange 3 cardamom pods 100ml double cream 100ml yoghurt
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Mix the rhubarb, sugar and orange juice and zest together and place in an ovenproof dish. Add the cardamom pods. Cover and bake for 30–45 minutes, until the rhubarb is completely soft. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely. Take out the cardamom pods and purée the fruit. Whip the cream with the yoghurt until it just holds its shape. Carefully fold the purée into the cream so you have a ripple effect, then transfer the mixture to serving glasses. Chill before serving.
