Parsnip purée
Introduction:
As well as being a classic accompaniment to roast duck, this silky-smooth recipe works well as a dip or as a weaning dish. The milk or cream could also be substituted with crème fraîche for a lighter, sharper finish. Some of the veg could be replaced with celeriac, swede, carrots or even apples. 
Ingredients:
200g parsnips, peeled & roughly chopped 100g potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped 60g butter 120ml milk or single cream nutmeg, grated, or ground cinnamon, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the parsnips and potatoes in boiling salted water. Drain thoroughly, and return to the pan. Add a large knob of butter, and start mashing over a low heat. Gradually mash enough milk or cream to give a creamy purée. Season with nutmeg or cinnamon, and plenty of salt and pepper. Serve.
