Slice fennel bulbs lengthways, brush with a little olive oil and cook on a ridged grill pan until charred and tender. Meanwhile, heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy-based pan, add the garlic and cook gently for a few minutes, until softened but not coloured. Stir in the tomatoes and sugar and raise the heat until the tomatoes are simmering. Lower the heat again and cook gently for about 1 hour, until reduced and thickened. Season well. Mix the sauce with the grilled fennel and dress with finely chopped chilli and mint, plus some oil and lemon.
