Runner beans, cherry tomatoes and olives
Introduction:
This healthy vegan dish is a delicious accompaniment to almost any main, going especially well with grilled halloumi, chicken or lamb chops. It's very easy to whip up and has a good balance of crunch, saltiness and freshness. Basil leaves blacken quickenly when cut, so only shred them just before serving. You could also sprinkle over a little Parmesan or Pecorino. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, eg. light olive or sunflower 1 onion, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 500g runner beans, trimmed & finely sliced 1 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 punnet cherry tomatoes, halved 100g pitted kalamata olives, roughly chopped small handful fresh basil leaves, shredded
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Fry the onion very gently for 10 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the beans in salted water for 4 minutes. Drain, refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. Add the cherry tomatoes, olives and drained beans to the pan. Season. Cook for 2 minutes or so, stirring now and then, just until the tomatoes start to wilt. Add the vinegar, a good glug of olive oil (3-4 tablespoons), the shredded basil and toss together, checking the seasoning before serving.
