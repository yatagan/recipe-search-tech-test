Stir-fried sprouts with cranberries and pecans
Introduction:
This is a good, simple vegetarian side with a bit of crunch and sweetness. You could also make it with shredded cabbage or kale, or, instead of American-style cranberries and pecans try stir-frying with the traditional Asian flavourings of soy sauce and minced ginger, garlic and chilli. 
Ingredients:
50g dried cranberries 75g shelled pecan nuts, roughly chopped 500g Brussels sprouts 1 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Put the cranberries in a small bowl and pour over just enough boiling water to cover them. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes, then drain. Put the pecans in a dry frying pan and toast for a couple of minutes. Remove from the pan and roughly chop. Leave to one side. Cut the sprouts in half, lay each half flat on your chopping board and finely shred the leaves. Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the sprouts and fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the cranberries and nuts, season well and toss together to serve.
