Mustard rough puff pastry
Introduction:
This is a delicious pastry to have on hand to take a beef pie or pastry to the next level. 
Ingredients:
250g strong white flour 1 tsp baking powder 200g butter, cold & diced 100ml water (or white wine) 1 egg yolk ½ tsp dried thyme 1 tsp English mustard powder
Method:
Put the strong white flour and baking powder in a bowl, add the cold, diced butter and gently mix. You don’t want crumbs (as with shortcrust), just a lumpy mess. In a separate bowl, beat the water or white wine, egg yolk, dried thyme and English mustard powder (both optional) together, pour into the flour mix, and combine into a rough dough ball. Roll the dough out to 1cm thick, using lots of flour to stop it sticking, then fold into thirds. Roll again, fold again, then wrap in clingfilm and freeze for 20 minutes. Repeat the double roll-and-fold action and chill for 20 minutes before using as above.
