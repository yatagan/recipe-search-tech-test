Mushroom sauce
Introduction:
This is a wonderful sauce that can be eaten straight up as a starter or snack, still bubbling in the pan with hunks of bread to sop it up; tossed with pasta for a quick vegetarian weeknight dinner; or paired with a steak, pork medallions, chicken or game. 
Ingredients:
15-20g dried porcini mushrooms 500ml hot water 2 tbsp olive oil ½ onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 300g mushrooms, sliced 2 tbsp thyme leaves, chopped juice of ½ lemon 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 3 tbsp crème fraîche salt & pepper
Method:
Soak the dried porcini in very hot water for at least 30 minutes. Drain the water into a jug and finely slice the porcini. Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 5 minutes before adding the porcini, garlic, mushrooms and thyme. Cook the contents of the pan for a further 5 minutes and then pour in the water that was used to soak the porcini. Bring the contents of the pan to a simmer and reduce the sauce until the porcini water is almost absorbed. Remove the pan from the heat and add the lemon juice and chopped parsley. Stir in the crème fraiche and season well.
