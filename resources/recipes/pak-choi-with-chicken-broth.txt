Pak choi with chicken broth
Introduction:
This recipe is ideal for chilly autumn evenings and like so many chicken soups, makes an excellent and comforting antidote to colds and flu. If you want a more substantial broth add some egg noodles towards the end of the cooking time.
Ingredients:
1 chicken 4 garlic cloves, sliced 2cm piece fresh ginger, sliced 2 onions, sliced 3 spring onions, sliced 1 star anise 2 corn cobs 2 carrots, cut into batons 1 celery stalk, sliced 600g pak choi, white stalks sliced, leaves left whole soy sauce, to taste sesame oil, to taste
Method:
Place the chicken in a pan in which it fits snugly and add enough water to cover. Add the garlic, ginger, onions and star anise and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer very gently for about an hour, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Strain the stock into a clean pan. Stand the corn cobs upright on a board and slice off the kernels, then add them to the stock together with the carrots and celery. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the meat from the chicken in strips. Add the chicken and pak choi to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Season with soy sauce, a dash of sesame oil to taste and garnish with extra sliced spring onions.
