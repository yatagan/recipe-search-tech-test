Jerusalem artichoke & leek soup
Introduction:
This creamy soup can be dressed with fancy garnishes (see below) or left plain and eaten with crusty bread for an easy midweek meal. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp sunflower, vegetable or rapeseed oil 2 leeks, washed & sliced 1 onion, sliced 600g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean, peeled & roughly chopped 1.2 litres vegetable stock, plus a little extra to thin if needed 1 bay leaf 2 rosemary sprigs pinch of freshly grated nutmeg salt & black pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in large pan. Add the leeks and onion and fry on a very low heat for 10 minutes, until softened, stirring now and then to stop them catching. Add the artichokes, stock, bay leaf and rosemary and season with the grated nutmeg and salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 25â€“30 mins, until the artichokes are very soft. Remove the bay leaf and rosemary then blitz the soup in a food processor or blender, adding a little more stock or water to thin to your preferred consistency. For an even smoother, creamier texture, pass the soup through a sieve. Reheat gently and check the seasoning before serving.
