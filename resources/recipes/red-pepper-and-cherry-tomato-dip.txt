Red pepper and cherry tomato dip
Introduction:
We served this as a starter in the Travelling Field Kitchen alongside a beetroot dip and hummous with fresh bread and vegetable crudités. The colours are amazing. 
Ingredients:
4 red peppers 400g cherry tomatoes 2 red onions, sliced 6 garlic cloves dash balsamic vinegar pinch brown sugar handful fresh basil 2 tbsp mascarpone salt & pepper
Method:
Roast the peppers (whole), tomatoes, onions and garlic with a dash of balsamic vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper in the oven at 200˚C until the peppers begin to blister. Keeping the peppers whole makes them easier to peel later on.Cover with clingfilm and cool. Skin and de-seed the peppers. Blend all of the mixture in a food processor adding extra salt, pepper, sugar and vinegar to taste. Pulse in the basil and mascarpone to finish.
