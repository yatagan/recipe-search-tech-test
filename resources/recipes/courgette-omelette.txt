Courgette omelette
Introduction:
Quickly whipped up, healthy and deliciously herby. To serve, spoon a couple of large dollops of sour cream or crème fraîche, if using, down the centre, then flip the sides of the omelette over to cover them and slide out onto a serving dish. Goat's cheese, fried mushrooms or slithers of smoked salmon or Parma ham would be very good additions. 
Ingredients:
225g courgettes 5 eggs, beaten 2 tbsp Gruyère cheese, grated 1 tbsp fresh chives, chopped 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 1 large garlic clove, finely chopped 15g butter soured cream or crème fraîche, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Quarter the courgettes lengthwise, then cut into 2.5cm lengths. Spread out in a colander, sprinkle with salt and leave for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry on kitchen paper. Beat the eggs with the Gruyère, herbs, salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a wide frying-pan over a brisk heat. Add the courgettes and sauté until just beginning to brown. Add the garlic and continue frying until browned and tender. Add the butter and stir until it is melted and foaming. Pour in the egg mixture and cook as for a normal omelette over a moderate heat, pulling up the edges to allow the liquid egg to trickle underneath. When the omelette is just done it should be set but still moist on the surface.
