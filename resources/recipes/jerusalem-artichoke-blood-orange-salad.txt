Jerusalem artichoke & blood orange salad with chilli & herbs
Introduction:
Nutty tasting artichokes are paired with sweet-sharp blood oranges in this colourful winter salad. If you don’t have blood oranges, use a standard orange instead. It can be served as a light lunch or side dish. The dressing makes more than is needed for this recipe but it’s hard to make any less, so save the rest in the fridge to use another time.
Ingredients:
150g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean 1 lemon 2 blood oranges ½ tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp cider vinegar olive oil 100g watercress or mixed salad leaves small bunch mint, leaves roughly shredded small bunch parsley, leaves roughly chopped 1 chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 50g walnut pieces, toasted & roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Finely slice the Jerusalem artichokes using a mandolin or sharp knife. They brown quickly, so place in a bowl of cold water with a good squeeze of lemon juice. Finely zest the oranges and keep the zest to one side. Trim the top and bottom of the oranges then follow the curve of the fruit and cut away the peel in a downwards motion. Cut between the membranes to free the segments. Squeeze the juice from the orange cores into a small bowl. Make the dressing. In a large bowl, whisk the mustard and vinegar together. Whisk in 3 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of orange juice. Season with salt and pepper. Drain the artichokes. Mix them into the dressing bowl with the watercress or salad leaves, orange segments, three-quarters of the herbs and half the chilli. Arrange the salad on a large plate. Top with the walnuts, remaining herbs and extra chilli, to your taste for heat.
