Green salad with goat's cheese
Introduction:
A vegetarian recipe for goat's cheese salad with a goat's cheese dressing. This dish can be a simple starter or its own, or treat it as a starting point for a light lunch or dinner and throw in any additions you fancy: broad beans, peas, mint, slivers of raw courgette, asparagus, a handful of cooked pearl barley, cubes of cooked beetroot, a scattering of pecans, walnuts or pumpkin seeds. 
Ingredients:
50g soft rindless goat’s cheese 100ml olive oil 1 small garlic clove, finely minced juice of ½-1 lemon 4 handfuls mixed salad leaves 2 tsp olive oil a few chunks of any leftover goat’s cheese bread, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Mash the goat’s cheese with a fork and gradually add the olive oil to make a smooth paste. Add garlic, salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste. If the dressing is very thick add water, a little at a time, until the dressing is the consistency of double cream. When you are ready to serve, toss the salad leaves in the 2 teaspoon olive oil to lightly coat and a few drops of lemon juice. Turn onto a platter and drizzle over the goat’s cheese dressing. Scatter over any of the optional salad toppings plus the leftover goat’s cheese and serve.
