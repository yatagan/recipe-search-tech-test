Courgettes in batter
Introduction:
The key to crispiness here is to slice the courgettes thinly and fry them at a high heat. These make good tapas with a sprinkling of salt or some dipping sauce. They also pair well with lamb and fish. If you're lucky enough to get hold of some courgette flowers (which are too delicate to pack in the veg boxes), these are good treated in the same way. 
Ingredients:
150g plain flour 2 tbsp olive oil 2 egg whites, stiffly whipped 2 courgettes salt & pepper
Method:
Make a light batter by mixing the flour with the olive oil and enough lukewarm water to give the consistency of double cream. Leave to rest for 20 minutes. Just before use, fold in the stiffly whipped egg whites and some seasoning. Cut courgettes into chips, dip them in the batter and deep-fry until light brown.
