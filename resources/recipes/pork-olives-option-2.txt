Pork olives with spinach and feta
Introduction:
These are delicious when cooked in the oven – not too hot, so that the filling oozes out, as with a badly made chicken kiev, but doesn’t cremate in the roasting pan. 
Ingredients:
4 pork steaks 1 large onion, very finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 5 slices stale bread (two for the stuffing & three for crumbing) 100g Parmesan, grated 100g feta 600g cooked spinach, squeezed to remove excess water 100ml olive oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Prepare the pork. Cut each steak in half and using a rolling pin, flatten into thin rectangular escalopes, big enough to wrap 1 tablespoon of stuffing. Don’t get too enthusiastic or the escalopes will just fall apart – you want them as thin as possible but still in one piece. Trim the edges, dice the trimmings and put to one side. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a small pan. Add the finely chopped onion, garlic and pork trimmings and sauté for 5 minutes or so. Allow to cool, transfer to a food processor and add the cheeses and cooked spinach. Pulse a couple of times so you have a reasonably uniform mixture without any obvious lumps of feta and spinach stalks. Put 1 tablespoon of mixture at the end of a pork escalope. Carefully roll up, folding in the sides as you go to completely seal, to stop the filling escaping when cooking. Don’t worry if they look like a dog’s dinner – they’ll taste the same. Skewer. Oil, crumb and place in a roasting tray. Sprinkle the remaining breadcrumbs on top and bake at as above. Don’t worry about turning over – the crisper the topping the better. You’ll have quite a bit of the stuffing mixture left over - gently warm it up and serve as a side.
