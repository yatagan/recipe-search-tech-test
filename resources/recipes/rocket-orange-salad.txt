Rocket and orange salad
Introduction:
This sweet and piquant salad has lots of variations. You could include a handful of different salad leaves; add in some creamy mozzarella or crumbled goat's cheese; make it a vegetarian meal by serving on top of couscous; or pare it right down to just rocket leaves and oranges. It's particularly lovely with blood oranges when they're in season. 
Ingredients:
100g rocket 60g olives, pitted & sliced 20g capers 2 oranges, peeled, thinly sliced, slices cut into quarters olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the rocket, olives, capers and orange pieces together in a large bowl. Drizzle with just enough olive oil to coat and season to taste.
