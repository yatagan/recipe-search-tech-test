Pork larp
Introduction:
Also called larb or laap, this pork dish has a beautiful balance of freshness, crunch and spiciness. There are quite a few ingredients, but preparing and assembling them is quick and simple. You could also add a little cooked diced potato or butternut squash. Little Gem is particularly good for scooping up the meat, but any other lettuce you'd like will also be fine. This is often served with a mango salad. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp groundnut oil 600g lean pork mince 1 lemongrass stem, pale section only, finely shredded 1 fresh long green chilli, finely chopped 60ml lime juice (bottled will do) 1 tbsp fish sauce 1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 1 tsp finely grated lime zest Â½ small red onion, thinly sliced 3 tbsp fresh coriander, roughly chopped 1 tbsp toasted rice, ground with a mortar and pestle 2 tbsp fresh mint, torn selection of: little gem lettuce leaves, blanched French beans, radish, fennel etc. to serve sprinkling of chopped roasted peanuts or cashews.
Method:
Heat half the oil in a wok over a high heat until nearly smoking. Add half the pork mince, the lemon grass and chilli and stir-fry, breaking up any lumps, for 3-4 minutes or until the pork changes colour. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat, reheating the wok between batches. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly. Whisk the lime juice, fish sauce, sweet chilli sauce and lime rind together in a bowl until well combined and then spoon over the pork mixture. Add the onion, coriander, ground toasted rice and mint and stir to combine. Spoon the pork mixture among salad veg and sprinkle with the toasted nuts to serve.
