Sage and anchovy fritters
Introduction:
This is an Italian treat (otherwise called Involutini di salvia) of anchovies sandwiched between sage leaves and deep fried. They're best enjoyed hot with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over and a cool beer on the side. 
Ingredients:
anchovies sage leaves 150g plain flour 2 tbsp olive oil 2 egg whites, stiffly whipped
Method:
Make a light batter by mixing the flour with the olive oil and enough lukewarm water to give the consistency of double cream. Leave to rest for 20 minutes. Just before use, fold in the stiffly whipped egg whites and some seasoning. To make each fritter, sandwich an anchovy fillet between 2 large sage leaves, dip in the batter and deep-fry until golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper and serve straight away.
