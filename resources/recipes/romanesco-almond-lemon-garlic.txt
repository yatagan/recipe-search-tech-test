Roasted Romanesco with almond, lemon and garlic dressing
Introduction:
This light and zesty dish goes well with pork or fish, or make it into a quick main by tossing it with with pasta, a little extra olive oil and a healthy sprinkling of grated Parmesan. Its delicate flavours go well with lighter pasta – white linguine or brown rice noodles. 
Ingredients:
1 Romanesco, cut in half, stalk removed, then cut into florets 1½ tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp flaked almonds, roasted in the oven until browned 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp lemon juice & more to taste 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Toss the Romanesco with the oil in a baking dish. Roast in the oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until just tender but with some bite. To make the dressing, crush the almonds in a pestle and mortar, add the garlic and lemon juice and mash to a paste. Slowly add olive until the dressing is of a drizzling consistency. Season well with salt and pepper. Alternatively blitz all the ingredients in a food processor. Drizzle the dressing over the Romanesco while still warm. Sprinkle over some chopped parsley to serve.
