Crunchy cucumber salad with smoked fish and sour cream
Introduction:
This classic Scandinavian combination of smoked fish, cucumber and dill makes a light summer lunch or dinner. 
Ingredients:
1 mini or ½ large cucumber 4 radishes 1 small fennel bulb 4 tbsp sour cream ½ lemon 2 tbsp olive oil ½ small garlic clove, finely minced small bunch fresh dill, chopped 50g mixed salad leaves 250g hot smoked fish (salmon, trout or mackerel), flaked salt & pepper
Method:
Peel and deseed the cucumber and slice into chunky wedges on an angle. Cut the radishes into eight along their length. Trim the tops and outer layer from the fennel. Cut into quarters and slice out the root, leaving just enough to keep things held together. Cut lengthways into thin wedges. To make the dressing, thin the sour cream with a good squeeze of lemon juice, then slowly whisk in the oil. Stir in the garlic then season generously with salt and more lemon juice if you think it needs it. Stir through the dill. Toss the salad leaves, vegetables and dressing together. Stack on to plates and crumble the fish on top.
