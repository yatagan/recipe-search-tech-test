purple sprouting broccoli with roasted garlic, capers, shallots and anchovies
Introduction:
A loud, punchy dressing for those who love strong, piquant flavours. For a vegetarian version replace the anchovies with a teaspoon or two of smooth Dijon mustard. 
Ingredients:
1 scant tbsp of capers (small if possible, if not, chop them roughly) 1 bulb of roasted garlic 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tsp cider vinegar 150g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed if necessary & divided into similar-sized pieces 2 small shallots, very finely sliced or diced 3 or 4 anchovy fillets, finely chopped salt & black pepper
Method:
If your capers are brined, soak them in cold water for 20 minutes or so to remove the excess salt (skip this step if they come in oil). Squeeze the roasted garlic flesh out of its skin and mash to a purée using the back of a fork. Add the olive oil and cider vinegar and mix into a paste. Steam or boil the broccoli for 3–4 minutes, until just cooked. Gently toss the warm broccoli with the garlic paste, shallots, anchovies and capers and add salt and pepper to taste.
