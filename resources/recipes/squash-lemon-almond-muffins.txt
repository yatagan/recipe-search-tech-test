Squash, lemon and almond muffins
Introduction:
Butternut squash and ground almonds lend a gorgeous moistness to these easy to make muffins, working a bit in the same way as the carrots in carrot cake. You'll need muffin cases and a muffin tin for baking. 
Ingredients:
300g squash, peeled & diced weight 125g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature 125g light brown soft sugar 3 eggs, beaten together 1 tsp almond essence zest of 2 lemons, finely grated 125g self raising flour 150g ground almonds 1 tbsp clear runny honey 12 whole blanched almonds, toasted in a dry frying pan until lightly golden
Method:
Steam or boil the diced squash for 15 minutes, until very soft. Drain and leave to cool, then mash with a potato masher. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl (an electric hand-held mixer makes life easier), until pale, light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs. Stir in the almond essence, lemon zest and mashed squash. Add the flour and ground almonds and fold in gently. Spoon roughly equal quantities of the mixture into your muffin cases. Bake for 5 minutes, then turn the heat to 180°C/Gas 4 and cook for about 20 minutes until golden. Leave to cool. Gently warm the honey in a small pan. Brush a little over the top of each muffin and top with an almond.
