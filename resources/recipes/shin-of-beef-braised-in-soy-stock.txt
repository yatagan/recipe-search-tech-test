Shin of beef braised in soy stock
Introduction:
Shin of beef has lots of connective tissue, but patient slow-cooking brings it to melt-in-the-mouth tenderness. Infused with aromatic soy-flavoured stock, it's delicious cooled, pressed, then arranged in thinly cut slices, perhaps with a scattering of bean sprouts and spring onion. A very special Chinese-style starter. 
Ingredients:
250ml soy sauce 150ml mirin or dry sherry 25g fresh ginger, sliced 2-3 star anise 1 garlic clove 1 red chilli 1 piece dried orange peel 600g shin of beef
Method:
Place all the ingredients, except the beef, in a saucepan with 750ml of water and bring to the boil then simmer for 15 minutes. Immerse the shin joint. Return to the boil and skim away impurities then turn down to a bare simmer for a further 2Â½-3 hours until tender (you may have to top up the stock with water). Drain, cool and press with a weight overnight before slicing as thinly as possible.
