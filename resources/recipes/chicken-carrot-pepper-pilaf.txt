Chicken, carrot and pepper pilaf
Introduction:
This fragrant, one-pot chicken pilaf is very simple to make and good for a midweek dinner. You can use brown or wild rice instead of white â€“ just adjust the cooking time accordingly. Make sure the chicken juices run clear and it is cooked through before serving. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 4 chicken thighs 1 large onion, sliced 1-2 garlic cloves, peeled & crushed 1 red pepper, deseeded & chopped into bite size pieces 2 large carrots, peeled & finely diced 1 tsp garam masala 2 tsp curry powder, whichever strength you prefer 1 tsp chilli powder 200g basmati rice 600ml chicken stock small handful sultanas or chopped dried apricots handful toasted flaked almonds to serve plain yoghurt, to serve coriander or parsley, chopped, to serve (optional)
Method:
In a large frying pan or hob-proof casserole, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and fry the chicken thighs on both sides for 2-3 minutes until browned. Remove from the pan and keep to one side. Add the other tablespoon of oil and add the onion. Fry gently for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic, pepper and carrots. Fry gently for another 4-5 minutes, until just softening. Add the garam masala, curry and chilli powder. Put the chicken back in the pan with the rice, stock and sultanas or apricots. Stir well, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken and rice are cooked through and the stock absorbed. Add a little more stock or water if it starts to catch on the bottom of the pan. Leave the dish to stand for a few minutes, then serve topped with toasted flaked almonds and yoghurt and chopped herbs if using.
