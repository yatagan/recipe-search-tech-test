Spiced winter vegetables
Introduction:
There's no need to use these exact proportions: if you don't have celeriac or swede in your veg box, substitute potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes or squash. Eat as a main with couscous or alongside roast chicken. 
Ingredients:
400g carrots 400g celeriac 400g parsnips 400g swede 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp paprika 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp lemon juice salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the root vegetables and cut them into dice Fry the vegetables in the olive oil until they colour. Add the spices and stir for a few moments. Add enough water to the pan to cover the vegetables, then boil until the vegetables are cooked and the liquid has evaporated. Add the lemon juice to the vegetables and season with salt and pepper.
