Red cabbage and beetroot confit
Introduction:
This confit is a meal itself, scooped over mash or a baked potato. It also makes a lovely contrast to roast duck, venison, pork, or sausages. It's an easy dish, requiring little attention once it's in the pan. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 large red onion, finely sliced 100ml red wine vinegar 100g light soft brown sugar 150g cranberry sauce, cranberry jelly or dark plum jam ½ small red cabbage, finely shredded 3 medium beetroot, peeled & cut into matchsticks on a mandolin, or grated splash balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a large, heavy-based saucepan, add the onion and sweat gently until soft but not coloured. Add the red wine vinegar, sugar and cranberry sauce and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the cabbage and beetroot, stir well, then cover and cook very gently for 30–40 minutes, until the vegetables are soft and the liquid has reduced to a sticky sauce. Adjust the seasoning with balsamic vinegar, celery salt and pepper.
