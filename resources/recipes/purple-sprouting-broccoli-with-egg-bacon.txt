Purple sprouting broccoli with egg, bacon and wild garlic croutons
Introduction:
This broccoli dish makes a great brunch, starter or light meal. It's best made with purple sprouting broccoli when it's in season. If you donâ€™t have any wild garlic, use chopped parsley for the croutons instead. You could leave out the bacon to make a vegetarian version of this. 
Ingredients:
4 eggs olive oil 2 thick slices bread, crusts removed, cut into 2cm cubes 2 tbsp wild garlic, finely chopped 100g bacon lardons (or smoked streaky bacon rashers cut into small pieces) 250g purple sprouting broccoli, cut into even sized pieces salt & pepper
Method:
Carefully lower the eggs into a pan of boiling water. Boil for 7 minutes for a soft boil, 8 for a slightly firmer yolk. Remove and plunge into a bowl of cold water. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan. Add the cubed bread and wild garlic and season. Cook on a low-medium heat for 4-5 minutes, turning occasionally until crisp. Leave in the warm pan. In another frying pan, fry off the bacon until crispy and golden brown. Meanwhile, in another pan, boil the purple sprouting broccoli for 3 minutes, then drain. Peel the eggs and chop into quarters. Arrange with the broccoli on serving plates and sprinkle over the bacon and croutons. Drizzle over a little extra olive oil if you like.
