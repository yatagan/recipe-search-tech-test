Summer pistou soup
Introduction:
There are literally hundreds of recipes for this Proven√ßal vegetarian soup and its Italian counterpart, minestrone. This one is designed to take advantage of summer abundance, but you can use pretty much any soup-friendly vegetable you like. The pistou sauce is a lovely addition, but Italian pesto is essentially the same sauce, and if you want to cut corners just use some good stuff from a jar. 
Ingredients:
for the pistou: 3 garlic cloves 1 tsp sea salt 50g basil leaves 50g Parmesan, grated (optional) 150ml olive oil for the soup: 200g broad beans, podded weight 2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 200g new potatoes (or other), scrubbed & diced 2 carrots, sliced 8 cherry tomatoes, cut into quarters 1.5 litres veg stock 250g asparagus, cut into 3cm lengths 200g white beans, cooked & rinsed salt & pepper
Method:
To make the pistou, pound the garlic and salt in a pestle and mortar. Pound in the basil (you may need some oil to loosen it), then the cheese and oil. Or you can blitz everything in a processor. For the soup: Boil the broad beans for 3 minutes, drain, refresh in cold water, drain again and remove the outer skins. Keep to one side. Heat the oil in a pan and cook the onion slowly for 8 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Add the potatoes, carrots, tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the broad beans, asparagus and white beans. Simmer for 3 minutes. Season and serve with the pistou to swirl through.
