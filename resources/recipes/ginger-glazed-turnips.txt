Ginger glazed turnips
Introduction:
This easy vegetarian recipe makes a good, inexpensive, satisfying side. If you have very small turnips leave them whole. The same method can be used very successfully for carrots â€“ or try a combination of both. 
Ingredients:
450g medium-sized turnips, peeled & cut into 1cm cubes 40g butter 2 tbsp ginger wine squeeze of lemon juice 1 tbsp caster sugar
Method:
Cook the turnip cubes in salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes or until almost tender. Drain and run under the cold tap. Drain thoroughly. Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the turnips. Fry for a minute or so. Add the remaining ingredients and stir over a medium heat until the turnip cubes are glazed with a rich syrup. Serve immediately.
