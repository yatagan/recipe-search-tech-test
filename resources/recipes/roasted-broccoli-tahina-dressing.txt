Roasted broccoli and tahini dressing
Introduction:
Roasting broccoli is a good way to intensify its taste, and this creamy but healthy dressing sets it off beautifully. You could serve the dressing as a dip with the broccoli alongside, or drizzle it over the top. Add more lemon if you like a more piquant taste. This goes especially well with salmon and chicken, or makes a light vegetarian meal stirred into quinoa. 
Ingredients:
1 head broccoli, cut into florets & chopped stalks too olive oil 3 tbsp tahini 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 3 tbsp water 2 tbsp rice or cider vinegar 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil 1½ tsp sugar 2 tsp lemon juice ½ tsp wasabi paste or English mustard 1 garlic clove, crushed salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. In a roasting tray, toss the broccoli in just enough oil to coat. Roast for about 12-15 minutes. In a bowl, make the dressing by combining the tahini, oil, water, vinegar and soy and mixing well until you have a smooth cream. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Drizzle over the broccoli.
