Stir-fried chilli chicken with szechuan pepper
Introduction:
This hot and sharp chicken dish makes a good dinner with a pile of rice. Szechuan peppercorns or 'flower peppers' are not peppers at all, but berries from a shrub belonging to the citrus family. Their taste, which is sharp rather than hot, is best brought out by dry-frying them over a medium heat for a few minutes until slightly browned. Remove from the heat then grind with a pestle and mortar or a coffee grinder, then keep in an air tight container. 
Ingredients:
450g skinless chicken breast 1 tbsp light soy sauce 2 tsp toasted sesame oil 2 tbsp dry sherry or rice wine 3 tbsp groundnut oil 225g mild green piquant peppers or chillies, sliced lengthways & seeds removed 3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 1 tsp szechuan peppercorns, roasted & crushed 2 tsp brown sugar
Method:
Cut the breast meat into thin slices and marinate in the light soy, sesame oil and sherry. Heat a wok or frying pan, add the groundnut oil and fry off the chicken slices (reserving the marinade) for a minute or so then remove with a slotted spoon. When hot again add the chillies, garlic and szechuan pepper to the oil and stir fry for a minute then add a splash of water, the soy, sherry marinade from the chicken, and sugar. Cook for a further minute then return the chicken to the pan and heat through (if you sliced it as thin as you should it will be cooked through). Serve over boiled rice.
