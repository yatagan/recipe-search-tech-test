Venison chilli with chocolate
Introduction:
This chilli might seem a little heavy on the beans, but that's the way we like it. The chocolate gives it extra richness and unctuousness. The extra spices make the whole dish a lot more balanced and interesting. If you have an army to feed, you can double the quantities by using more venison or adding in other diced or minced meat – the diced will give a bit of added texture. 
Ingredients:
500g minced venison ½ tsp dried oregano ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp cinnamon ½ tsp dried coriander 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 red chilli, deseeded & thinly sliced 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp coriander seeds 2 large onions, chopped 2 carrots, finely chopped 400g tin chopped tomatoes 100ml stock 2x400g tin kidney beans, drained 50g 85% dark chocolate salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the venison with the oregano, ground cumin, cinnamon, dried coriander and half the garlic and chilli, and leave to marinade for an hour or so. Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the cumin seeds and coriander seeds and gently cook, stirring regularly, until they start smelling. Add the onion, carrot and remaining garlic and cook over a low heat to soften. Now add the spiced up venison and increase the heat to brown it - breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, stock and remaining chilli. Cover with a lid and simmer gently for an hour, stirring occasionally. Add water if it gets too dry. It should be rich, red, and thickened. Finally, add the kidney beans and grate in the chocolate. Stir gently and cook for a further 10 minutes with the lid off. Adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve with the usual chilli accompaniments of rice etc.
