Lamb boulangère with broad beans
Introduction:
Fortunately, these days us poor folk aren’t dependent on the baker’s oven for our roast meat, as used to be the case. In fact we’re considerably poorer because we don’t have a local baker, but that’s another story. It doesn’t have to be just potatoes and onions though; parsnips, celeriac, swede etc. will all benefit from slicing and baking in stock, wine and the juices from the lamb. 
Ingredients:
1 lamb shoulder 2 generous fresh rosemary sprigs, chopped 3 garlic cloves, cut into slivers 2 tbsp olive oil 1kg mix potatoes, parsnips, celeriac, swede & carrot, peeled & thinly sliced 2 onions (or leeks), thinly sliced pinch herbs de provence (optional) 200ml stock, ideally lamb, but chicken will do 250ml white wine 1kg broad beans, podded & blanched in salted boiling water 40g butter
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6 and while it heats up, stick the lamb with the rosemary and slivers of garlic. Rub in a tablespoon of olive oil, and season well with salt and pepper. Put the lamb in a roasting tray and roast for 20-25 minutes. Toss the sliced vegetables in the remaining oil, herbs de Provence (if using) and salt and pepper. Take the lamb out of the oven, remove from the pan and deglaze with the stock and 100ml of the wine. Pour the liquid in with the vegetables, mix, and return to the roasting tray. Spread out the veg and dot the top with the butter. Place a trivet over the veg and put the lamb on it, skin side up. Alternately place it on the rack in the oven over the roasting tray. Turn the oven down to 150°C/Gas Mark 2 and cook for another 2 hours. Remove the lamb and the vegetables with a slotted spoon, leaving the liquid. Deglaze the pan with the remaining wine, reduce slightly and add the blanched beans. Stir around until reheated, and serve with the meat as a sort of bean gravy.
