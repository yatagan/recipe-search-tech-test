Celeriac and apple soup
Introduction:
A soup of creamy, earthy celeriac and sharp-sweet apple. To make it vegan, use stock in place of milk. If you are not vegetarian, fried lardons of bacon are a lovely topping. If you are vegetarian, try sage leaves fried in butter instead. This recipe could also be made with a couple of large parsnips instead of celeriac. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped ½ large celeriac, peeled & chopped 1 apple, cored & chopped 500ml veg stock leaves from 1-2 sprigs rosemary, or ½ tsp dried mixed herbs 250ml milk (or use all stock if vegan) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently for a few minutes until softened. Add the celeriac and apple and fry for a few more minutes. Add the stock and mixed herbs. Heat until just bubbling, reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, until the celeriac is tender. Remove from the heat, add the milk, and season well with salt and pepper to taste. Blend until smooth. Reheat to serve, adding a little more milk or stock if needed to thin the soup.
