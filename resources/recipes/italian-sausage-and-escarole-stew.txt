Italian sausage and escarole stew
Introduction:
Flavourful and inexpensive, this dinner recipe is quick and easy, but has an impressive, mature flavour that tastes as if it someone slaved over the stove for hours. Eat it with a bit of bread to soak up the juices. 
Ingredients:
4 Italian sausages 1 garlic clove, sliced half head escarole, shredded tin chickpeas, drained 1 tbsp tomato purée 100ml chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the sausages into chunks, fry until browned on both sides, then remove from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the escarole, stir until wilted, then add the chickpeas, tomato purée and chicken stock. Return the sausages to the pan, cook covered for 15 minutes, then season and serve.
