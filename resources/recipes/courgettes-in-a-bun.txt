Courgettes in a bun
Introduction:
This recipe might look a bit fiddly at first, but it's quite straightforward to follow. It's a lovely way of turning courgettes into a vegetarian lunch, and is good fun for kids to eat. Make this with the smallest, glossiest courgettes you can find: their taste and texture will be much the better. 
Ingredients:
4 buns or rolls 50g butter, softened 5 shallots or 1 large onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tsp turmeric 1½ tbsp plain flour 600ml milk 2 bay leaves 450g small courgettes olive oil to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the tops off the rolls to form lids. Using your fingers pull out the crumb in each roll and lid, to leave a hollow shell. Smear the insides generously with the softened butter. Set aside until needed. To make the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and add the shallots or onion. Stir and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the garlic and turmeric and stir again. Continue cooking over a gentle heat until the shallots or onion are tender, without letting them brown. Add the flour and stir for a few seconds. Gradually stir in the milk. Bring to the boil and add the bay leaves and pepper. Simmer gently until sauce is thick. Season to taste. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. 15 minutes before serving, put a pan of water on to boil. Put the buns, covered with their lids, in the oven. Re-heat the sauce. If the courgettes are very small and slender, boil them whole, otherwise, quarter lengthwise. Drain thoroughly. Place the buns on plates and fill with sauce. Arrange the courgettes in the buns, tips hanging out. Drizzle a little olive oil over each, then top with the lid and drizzle over a little more olive oil. Serve immediately.
