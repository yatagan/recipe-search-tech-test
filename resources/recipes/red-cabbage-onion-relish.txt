Red cabbage and onion relish
Introduction:
An easy, crunchy relish that's good with roasted duck. This quick marinating process results in cabbage that's slightly tenderised and packed with flavour. You could also try making it with white cabbage and eating with pork or fish. 
Ingredients:
300g red cabbage (about ¼ large cabbage), shredded very finely 1 small red onion, very finely sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed 3 tbsp red wine vinegar 1 tsp sea salt 2 tsp sugar ½ tsp ground allspice or 6 allspice berries, ground in a mortar ½ tsp ground coriander or 1 tsp coriander seeds, ground in a mortar ½ tsp ground nutmeg pinch dried chilli flakes (optional) good grinding black pepper 1-2 tbsp water (if needed) fresh parsley or coriander leaves, roughly chopped, to serve
Method:
Place the shredded cabbage and red onion in a mixing bowl. Stir through all ingredients except the water and fresh herbs. Taste a piece of the cabbage: if it is too strongly acidic (this will depend on the strength of your vinegar) add a tablespoon or two of water to dilute. Leave to macerate for at least one hour and up to 24 hours. When ready to serve, drain off excess liquid and mix through the fresh herbs. The relish can also be drained, refrigerated and covered until needed.
