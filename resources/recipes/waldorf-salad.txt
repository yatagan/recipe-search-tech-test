Waldorf salad
Introduction:
Who could eat this and not think of the classic Fawlty Towers episode? This recipe should clear up any strange ideas about what it includes. Try using grapes instead of soaked raisins and add 150g diced cooked chicken and a teaspoon of chopped tarragon. 
Ingredients:
3 tart green dessert apples, peeled, cored & sliced thinly 50g walnut halves, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan 4 celery stalks, peeled & thinly sliced (reserve a few celery leaves) 85g raisins, soaked in hot water for 1 hr about 3 tbsp mayonnaise 1 Cos or 2 Little Gem lettuces, shredded 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put apples in a bowl with the walnuts, celery and half the raisins. Add enough mayonnaise to coat, season to taste and toss well to combine. Arrange the shredded lettuce on a serving dish and place the salad on top. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins, plus the parsley and celery leaves.
