Mussels, leeks and bacon on toast
Introduction:
This makes a very special starter or light main, with the bread sopping up the lovely juices. The sweetness of the mussels and leeks goes brilliantly with the saltiness of the bacon. Mussels are easy to farm and more sustainable than most kinds of seafood. 
Ingredients:
500g mussels 1 tbsp olive oil 25g butter 4 leeks, thinly sliced 100g bacon lardons 100ml white wine 4 pieces of sourdough or ciabatta bread 2 garlic cloves 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
Method:
Scrub the mussels under cold running water, pulling off the "beards" and discarding any open mussels that don't close when tapped lightly on the work surface. Heat the oil and butter in a pan, add the leeks and bacon and cook for about 15 minutes, until the leeks are soft and flavoured with the bacon. Meanwhile, heat the white wine in a separate pan, add the mussels, then cover and cook over a medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes, until the mussels open (discard any that remain closed). Remove from the heat and strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a small pan. Simmer until reduced by half its volume. Remove the mussels from their shells and stir them into the leek and bacon mixture. Toast the bread, rub with the garlic and divide the mussel mixture between each piece. Drizzle with the reduced mussel cooking liquor, sprinkle with the parsley and serve.
