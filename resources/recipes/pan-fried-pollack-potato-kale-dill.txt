Pan-fried pollack with warm potato, kale and dill
Introduction:
A quick, healthy potato and fresh fish dinner. This doesn't have to be made with pollack – any sustainable white fish works well. If you don't have kale in your box, uses winter or summer greens, chard or spinach and adjust the cooking time accordingly. 
Ingredients:
900g potatoes, peeled & cut into 2cm dice 3 tsp coarse grain mustard 2 tsp clear honey 1 tbsp cider vinegar 2 tbsp olive oil 200g kale, leaves stripped from stalks & finely chopped 1 tbsp plain flour 4 pollack fillets, skin on (or other white fish) oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped lemon wedges, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water for 8-10 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, make the dressing: whisk the mustard, honey, vinegar and oil in a large bowl. Drain the potatoes and add them to the dressing while still warm. Add the raw kale, season and stir. Sprinkle the flour over the fish skin and season. Heat a little oil in a heavy-based non-stick frying pan. Add the fish, skin side down and leave to cook on a medium heat for about 3-4 minutes for a 2-3cm thick fillet. Turn it over – the skin should be crispy – if not, give it another minute on that side. Cook for about a minute or so on the other side to just cook it through. Stir the dill into the potato salad, then serve the fish with the potato salad and lemon wedges.
