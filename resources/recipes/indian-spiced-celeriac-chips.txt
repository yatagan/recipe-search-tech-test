Indian spiced celeriac chips
Introduction:
Golden brown, crispy and spicy on the outside and gently nutty and squidgy within, these oven-roasted chips makes a more virtuous and interesting alternative to classic potato chips. Adjust the amount of chilli according to taste. 
Ingredients:
1 celeriac juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp sunflower or rapeseed oil 2 tsp garam masala 1 tsp chilli powder (or just use ½ tsp for less heat, if you prefer) ¼ tsp turmeric coarse sea salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 6. Peel the celeriac with a large, sharp knife. Cut into 1½ -2cm slices, then into 1½-2cm thick chips. Toss in a bowl with the lemon juice as soon as you cut them, as celeriac can brown quickly. Add the oil and spices to the bowl and toss together to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet and spread them out in a single layer. Sprinkle over a little salt. Roast for 35-40 minutes, turning them once halfway through, until tender.
