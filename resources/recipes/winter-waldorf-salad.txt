Winter Waldorf salad
Introduction:
Gone is the cloying mayo in favour of a soured yoghurt dressing in this darker, hibernal take on a classic Waldorf. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp yoghurt olive oil 2 good handfuls black kale, red cabbage or radicchio, shredded 2 small sharp apples, cored & diced 2 celery sticks, finely diced 30g walnuts, chopped & toasted 40g dried cranberries or raisins or sour cherries salt & pepper
Method:
Make the dressing by whisking the vinegar and mustard together. Slowly whisk in the yoghurt followed by 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season well. Throw the remaining ingredients together and streak over the dressing to serve.
