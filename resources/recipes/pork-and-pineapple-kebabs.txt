Pork & pineapple kebabs
Introduction:
Strange as it sounds, pineapple does work both with pork and in kebabs. Using the pulp as a marinade will moisten and tenderise the meat by breaking down the collagen; something to do with bromelain (a combination of enzymes naturally present in the fruit) apparently. Tinned pineapple won’t have the same effect because it has been heat treated. Leave plenty of time for the flavours of the marinade to be soaked into the pork. 
Ingredients:
1 small pineapple, peeled, cored & in 3cm cubes 400g pork leg steaks, in 2.5cm cubes 1 tsp caribbean bbq jerk seasoning 1 tbsp hot chilli sauce, plus extra to serve (optional) 1 lime, zested & juiced 1 large onion, finely sliced 1 tbsp vegetable oil 200g basmati rice 400g tin black beans, drained & rinsed lime wedges, to serve for the sauce (optional): 1 lime, juiced 200ml veg stock 1 tbsp crème fraîche
Method:
Mash up a third of the pineapple in a bowl and mix with the pork, jerk seasoning, chilli sauce, lime zest and juice. Cover and leave for 2 hours. Remove the pork from the marinade, shaking off any excess (put the marinade to one side to use later), and thread the meat and remaining pineapple onto skewers. Fry the onion in a little oil until soft, add the rice and stir well to seal in the starch. Add salted boiling water (double the volume of rice). Bring to the boil, stir once, cover and cook on as gentle a heat as possible pork leg steaks until the rice is done (about 10 minutes). When done, add the beans, stir and keep warm. Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan or BBQ until very hot. Cook the kebabs for 3 minutes on each side, until nicely charred and the pork is cooked through. Serve skewers with the beans and rice, more chilli sauce, lime wedges and salad. Make the sauce> from the remaining marinade - add the veg stock, lime juice and crème fraîche. Bring to simmering point, give it a good stir, cook for a few more minutes and serve alongside the kebabs.
