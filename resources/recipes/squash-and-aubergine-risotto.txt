Squash and aubergine risotto
Introduction:
This is an easy recipe to make – the only challenge is some dedicated stirring. Squash is a lovely staple for risottos, giving them a beautiful, rich flavour. To keep this vegetarian, exchange the Parmesan for another hard cheese. Like all risotto recipes, this is versatile – aubergine and squash could be replaced with any other veg you like. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 75g butter 1.2 litres chicken or veg stock 4 fresh sage leaves, torn up 250g aubergine, cut into 1cm cubes, without peeling 500g winter squash or pumpkin, skinned, deseeded & cut into 1cm cubes 350g Arborio rice 2 medium-sized tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & chopped 150ml dry white wine 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 2½ tbsp freshly Parmesan, grated, & extra to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
In a heavy-based saucepan, large enough to take all the ingredients with room to spare, cook the onion in half the butter until tender, without browning. Meanwhile bring the stock to the boil in a separate pan. Turn the heat down as low as possible to keep hot, without actually boiling. Add the sage, aubergine and squash to the onion and stir for about a minute, before adding the rice. Continue stirring for another minute. Add the tomatoes, wine, salt and pepper, and simmer, stirring, until the wine has evaporated. Add a couple of ladlefuls of the hot stock. Simmer, stirring, until the liquid has evaporated. Repeat until the rice is tender but still al dente. Stir in the remaining butter, parsley, Parmesan (if using) and more pepper and salt if needed. Let it sit for a minute or so, then serve with more Parmesan to hand round if you like.
