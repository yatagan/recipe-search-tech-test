Scrambled tofu tacos with kidney beans, crunchy salad & soured cream
Introduction:
Tacos seem poised to have their moment in the culinary limelight. Mexican food has been a star in the street food firmament for the last few years; the burrito boom as it has become known. There is even such a thing as the taco-cleanse diet in the States, although I fear this says more about modern media fads than it does about the detoxifying properties of the humble taco. The taco is essentially a tortilla wrap stuffed full of delicious and complementary ingredients. I think we’ve managed to tick that box with plenty of crunch from the salad, punch from the chilli, protein from the beans and tofu, and a cooling tang from the soured cream.
Ingredients:
1 red pepper light olive oil 1 lemon 2 tsp brown sugar 1 red chilli 4 spring onions ½ cucumber 1 large or 2 small heads Little Gem lettuce 30g coriander 2 garlic cloves 1 tin kidney beans 2 tomatoes 200g tofu pot soured cream taco spice mix: 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp sweet smoked paprika ¼ tsp cinnamon pack tortillas salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the pepper in half, remove the seeds and slice into thin strips. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in the frying pan and fry the pepper gently for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, juice half the lemon and mix the juice with the brown sugar. Deseed and finely chop the red chilli. Keep the seeds in if you're keen on a bit more heat. Trim and very finely slice 4 spring onions. Take half of the cucumber and split it in half lengthways. Remove the soft, seedy core with the tip of a teaspoon and discard. Slice into half cm pieces at an angle. In a shallow bowl, mix the sliced onions and cucumber with the sweetened lemon juice, one third of the chopped chilli and a good pinch of salt. Leave to macerate while you continue. Cut the Little Gem lettuce into thin wedges. Wash and dry them well. Wash the coriander, shake dry and roughly chop, stalks and all. MISSING REMAINING RECIPE!?
