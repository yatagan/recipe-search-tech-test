Tomatillo, carrot, apple & ginger juice
Introduction:
Tomatillos are one of our quirkier crops. They originally hail from Mexico, where they’re used in almost everything. They juice well, with a tangy, citrus sweetness – balanced here by the earthy carrots and sweet apple. Just remember to remove the paper-lantern husks before using. This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order to plunge.
