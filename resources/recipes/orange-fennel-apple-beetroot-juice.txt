Orange, fennel, apple & beetroot juice
Introduction:
The aniseed taste of fennel can split people into love or hate camps. When used raw, it is not too pronounced, and comes across as clean and fresh rather than heavy and liquorice-like. If the jury is out for you, then maybe this preparation can persuade you. This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge.
