The healthy January roast chicken alternative
Introduction:
This is a lovely, lower fat alternative to the usual Sunday roast. It's also simpler to make, because it doesn't call for basting. The result is a fresh-tasting and delicious one-pot chicken dinner with delicate stock instead of gravy. 
Ingredients:
3 carrots, peeled & cut into chunks 2 large or 3 smaller leeks, cleaned & cut into 4-5cm pieces 3 sticks celery, cut into 2-3cm pieces 4 large or 8 smaller potatoes, scrubbed clean & quartered 2 fresh rosemary sprigs 2 fresh thyme sprigs 2 bay leaves 1 small whole chicken 1 litre hot veg or chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ËšC/Gas 4. Put the veg, herbs and chicken in a large casserole or roasting dish (one that fits all the ingredients snugly). Pour over the stock. Season the chicken. Transfer to the oven. Cook for 1 hour 20 minutes, basting the chicken with the stock every 20 minutes. Check the chicken is cooked through by inserting a sharp knife between the leg and main body of the chicken. The juices should run clear; cook for a little longer if needed, the timing may vary slightly depending on your oven. Drain off the stock and reduce in a pan by about a third or half. Season to taste. Spoon the veg into bowls, discarding the herbs. Carve the chicken and serve with the veg, with the stock poured over.
