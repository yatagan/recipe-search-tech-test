Himmel Und Erde
Introduction:
The unexpected, poetic name, meaning heaven and earth, refers to the apple from the trees and potatoes from the ground. This is classically eaten with black pudding, pork loins or chops, or sausages â€“ and of course sauerkraut or cabbage. A good variation is to substitute turnip for half of the potato. 
Ingredients:
1kg floury potatoes, e.g. Desiree or King Edward 450g cooking apples 1 tsp sugar, more to taste generous knob butter salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the potatoes and cut into chunks. Put in a pan with just enough lightly salted water to cover them. Bring to the boil and simmer until almost cooked. Meanwhile, peel, core and chop the apples roughly. Pour off about two thirds of the water the potatoes are cooking in, then add the apples and simmer gently until they have collapsed and potatoes are melting. Mash together, and season with salt, pepper and a little sugar. Stir in the butter, then tip into a serving dish and serve.
