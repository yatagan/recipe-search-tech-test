Kefir pancakes with baked plums
Introduction:
Based around a traditional Russian recipe called oladi, these kefir pancakes have a slight sour tang that works perfectly with sweet fruit. The baked plums are a brilliant partner in late autumn, but the pancakes would happily pair with strawberries and soft summer fruits when the sun is shining.
Ingredients:
500ml kefir 1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk 40g caster sugar 300g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder pinch of salt 6 ripe plums 1 cinnamon stick 1 star anise 1 nutmeg 3 tbsp honey zest and juice of ½ an orange
Method:
Preheat the oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Halve the plums and place them in a snug-fitting roasting tin. Throw in the cinnamon stick, star anise and a cautious grating of nutmeg. Tip in the honey, orange juice and zest. Give everything a mix. Bake for 20 mins, or until the plums are soft and beginning to collapse. While the plums cook, whisk the kefir, eggs and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl and then add a good pinch of salt. Mix together until smooth. Leave to rest for 10 mins or so. To cook the pancakes, heat a thin layer of oil in a non-stick frying pan and dollop generous spoonfuls of the mix into the pan. Cook over a medium heat, until golden brown on the bottom. Flip them over and cook the other side. You’ll probably have to cook these in two or three batches, so keep the first lot warm in a low oven. You should get at least 12 pancakes. Serve the pancakes alongside the warm baked plums.
