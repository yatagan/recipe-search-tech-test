Steak & Roasted Ratatouille with Aioli
Introduction:
This is a very simple and fast ratatouille. You want the veg to take on some colour, even some slightly burnt edges, as much for texture as for taste. The tomatoes should collapse and create a sauce.
Ingredients:
2 sirloin steaks 1 large or 2 small red onions 2 courgettes 2 red peppers 250g cherry tomatoes light olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 2 garlic cloves 1 tsp dried oregano 50g mayonnaise salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220ËšC/Gas Mark 7. Remove the steaks from the fridge. Season them well with salt and pepper. Leave them at room temperature while you prepare everything else. Wash the courgettes and cut into 2cm chunks. Peel the onion(s) and cut into 10-12 wedges. Remove the stalks from the red peppers and cut them in half. Remove the seeds and slice into generous strips. Cut all the tomatoes in half. Put all the veg in the roasting tray and mix with 2 tablespoons of oil, the balsamic vinegar and a seasoning of salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes. Crush 1 garlic clove with the heel of your hand so it just breaks open. Add to the roasting pan after the first 20 minutes, along with the dried oregano. Mix well and return to the oven for 10 more minutes. While the veg cooks make the aioli. Peel and chop or crush the remaining garlic clove. Take half the chopped clove and mix well with the mayonnaise. Add more if you like it stronger. 5 minutes before the veg has cooked, heat a dash of oil in the frying pan. When very hot, fry the steaks for 1 minute on each side. Remove to a plate to rest for 3-4 minutes. Check the seasoning on the ratatouille. Adjust with salt and pepper as you see fit. Stir in the juices from the rested steak. Serve alongside the steaks, with a blob of aioli.
