Fried eggs and grilled peppers
Introduction:
Serve this for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Capers or shaved Parmesan or Pecorino make excellent additions. If you're feeling greedy turn the whole thing into one sandwich and eat the whole thing yourself. 
Ingredients:
1 large red pepper 2 thick slices of bread oil for frying, e.g. olive 2 eggs dash of balsamic or sherry vinegar 4 large fresh basil leaves, torn up salt & pepper
Method:
Quarter the pepper and remove stalk, seeds and white membrane. Grill, skin side close to heat until skin is blackened and blistered. Drop into a plastic bag, knot and leave until cool enough to handle. Strip off skin and then cut into strips. Reserve along with any juice. Fry the eggs in oil to preferred done-ness. Toast the bread, then pile with eggs, then peppers, topping off with a dash of vinegar, torn basil leaves and seasoning.
