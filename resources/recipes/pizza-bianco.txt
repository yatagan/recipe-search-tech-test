Pizza bianco
Introduction:
This tomato-less pizza is all about delicate flavours – creamy mozzarella, succulent, earthy mushrooms and crispy golden potatoes. If you’re in the mood for something more pungent you can crumble over some blue cheese before baking. 
Ingredients:
125g self-raising flour pinch salt 75ml warm water 2 potatoes, peeled & finely sliced oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 small onions, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed 100g mushrooms, cleaned & sliced leaves from 2 sprigs rosemary 125g buffalo mozzarella olive oil, for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
To make the pizza bases, put the flour and salt in large bowl. Gradually add the warm water and mix thoroughly to make a dough. Remove to a floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth. Halve the mixture and roll out each half into a rough circle, as thinly as possible so they are roughly the size of a dinner plate, and put on a non-stick baking tray (you may need two). Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 7. In a saucepan of boiling, salted water, cook the potatoes for 4 minutes. Drain and leave to one side. Meanwhile in another pan, heat a little oil and add the onion. Fry gently for 5 minutes, add the garlic, mushrooms, rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Fry for 3-4 minutes, until the mushrooms are just tender then remove from the heat. Spread the onion and mushroom mixture over the base of the pizzas, then add the mozzarella, torn into pieces and dotted about. Place the sliced potatoes over the top and season with black pepper. Drizzle over a little olive oil and bake in the oven for 12-14 minutes, until the base is cooked through and the top golden.
