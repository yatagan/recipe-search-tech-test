New potato and pickled herring salad with sour cream
Introduction:
A clean-flavoured Nordic salad of waxy new potatoes and tangy herrings in a creamy, sweet-and-sour sauce. This is a good dish for summer with a green salad and some buttered brown bread – preferably rye. It makes a substantial starter or light lunch dish. You could also add some slices or cooked beetroot or gherkins to the mix.
Ingredients:
500g new potatoes 1 small onion, very finely sliced 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp caster sugar 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 5 tbsp crème fraîche or sour cream 4 pickled herring fillets (Swedish matjes if possible, otherwise rollmops), sliced handful fresh dill or chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes, drain and slice thickly. While still warm, combine the sliced onion, olive oil, sugar and vinegar, pour over the potatoes and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste and leave to cool. Add the crème fraîche or sour cream plus herrings along with most of the dill or chives and mix through. If possible allow to marinate for another half an hour before serving, sprinkled with remaining herbs and accompanied by a green salad and buttered brown bread if you like.
