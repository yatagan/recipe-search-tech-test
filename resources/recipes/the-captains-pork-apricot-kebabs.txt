The captain’s pork and apricot kebabs
Introduction:
A fragrant, punchy dish, excellent served with rice. It takes a little prep and marinading time, so maybe better for a relaxed weekend meal. 
Ingredients:
120g dried apricots 1 small onion, finely chopped 2 tbsp captain’s curry masala paste (see below) 2 tbsp lemon juice 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp soft light brown sugar 150ml vegetable stock 400g diced pork for the captain’s curry masala paste: 75g cashew nuts 75g golden sultanas 2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped 20g ginger, peeled & roughly chopped 2 tsp red chilli powder 1 tsp cumin powder 1 tsp turmeric 200g tinned tomatoes
Method:
First make the paste. Boil the nuts for 5 minutes in a little water, then drain. Place in a blender with the other paste ingredients and whizz to a fine paste. Take out 2 generous tablespoons and freeze the rest for kedgeree, curries etc. Bring the apricots to a simmer in barely enough water to cover them, remove from the heat and leave for 15 minutes. Drain and blitz with a little of the cooking liquor, until smooth. Next, heat the oil in a pan, soften the onion, add the curry paste, followed by the puréed apricots, lemon juice, bay leaf and sugar. Pour in the stock and stir. Season, then leave to cool. When cold, add the pork, stir, then cover and leave to marinate in a cool place for 3-4 hours. Soak 8 small beech kebab sticks in water. Slice the remaining apricots into thirds and make the kebabs: pork, apricot, pork etc. Don’t crowd them on the sticks. Grill (not too near the heat) for 10 minutes per side until cooked and golden brown. Meanwhile, reheat the leftover apricot marinade in a pan, simmer gently for a couple of minutes. Serve with Basmati rice and the marinade.
