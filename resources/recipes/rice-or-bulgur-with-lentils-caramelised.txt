Rice or bulgur with lentils and caramelised onion
Introduction:
A hearty, inexpensive Lebanese pilaf of rice and lentils topped with caramelised onions. This is simple to make and works well as a vegetarian main - try it with this Middle Eastern cabbage salad. Drizzle over yoghurt for creaminess and eat warm or cold. You could also play around with the spicing: try adding a pinch of cinnamon, turmeric or allspice along with the cumin. 
Ingredients:
2-3 onions, halved & finely sliced 3 tbsp olive oil 200g dried lentils (or a can of cooked lentils) 1 tsp ground cumin 200g rice or bulgur wheat 2 tsp vegetable bouillon or a stock cube dissolved in a little hot water salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the onion gently in the olive oil until golden brown for 20 minutes or so. Meanwhile if using dried lentils, cover in unsalted water and bring to the boil. Turn down to simmer and cook until tender, about 25 minutes, then drain. Add the salt, pepper and cumin. Cook the rice or bulgur at the same time, adding the bouillon or stock cube to the cooking water. Combine lentils, rice or bulgur and most of the onions with their oil, reserving a little onion to scatter over the dish as a garnish. Add more salt and pepper as needed and serve hot or cold.
