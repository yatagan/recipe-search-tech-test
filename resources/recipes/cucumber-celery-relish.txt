Cucumber celery relish
Introduction:
A simple to follow recipe for gently spiced sweet and sour relish. This goes well with fish, chicken or even bread and cheese. It's a good way to use up that half cucumber and end of a head of celery that would otherwise languish in the salad drawer. 
Ingredients:
½ cucumber, finely diced salt 2 stalks celery, finely diced 4 tbsp rice or white wine vinegar 1½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled & grated 2 tsp caster sugar 1½ tsp mustard seeds 1 tsp dill seed ½ medium onion, very finely diced ½-1 green chilli, deseeded & very finely chopped
Method:
Spread the cucumber dice out in a colander and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt. Leave to drain for 30 minutes, then rinse and pat dry. Mix with the celery. Place the vinegar, ginger, sugar and seeds in a small saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Simmer for 2 minutes then add the onion and chilli, stir and draw off the heat. Mix with the cucumber and celery. Cool and leave for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours, covered and in the fridge. This will keep for up to a week in a jar in the fridge.
