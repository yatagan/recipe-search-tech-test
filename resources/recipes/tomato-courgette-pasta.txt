Chunky tomato and courgette pasta bowl
Introduction:
This is a simple, fresh tasting dish for when you've got really lovely, ripe tomatoes on hand. Adding good quality stock rather than a stock cube makes all the difference here. Use veg stock and Pecorino instead of Parmesan in you're a vegetarian. If you don't have any basil, garnishing with fresh coriander or parsley also works well. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp tomato purée 480g punnet tomatoes, skinned & diced 2 courgettes, cut into 2cm dice 2 carrots, cut into 2cm dice 1 litre chicken stock 200g small pasta shapes, e.g. orzo, small conchiglie or macaroni handful basil leaves, shredded 50g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and fry very gently, stirring now and then to stop it catching, for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 2 minutes. Add the tomato purée, tomatoes, courgettes and carrots and stir for 2 minutes. Add the stock and season. Bring to the boil. Add the pasta, reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the pasta is just tender. Shred the basil leaves and stir them in, with half the Parmesan. Check the seasoning, divide between 4 serving bowls and serve sprinkled with the rest of the cheese.
