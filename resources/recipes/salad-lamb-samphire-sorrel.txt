Salad of cold roast lamb, samphire, sorrel and parsley
Introduction:
Samphire goes wonderfully well with lamb, a logical pairing when you think of the similar salty, savoury punch you get from those other ovine loving ingredients the caper and anchovy. The lemony tones of the sorrel and grassy notes of the parsley echo samphire’s traditional home with all things seafood. 
Ingredients:
150g cold roast lamb, finely sliced or shredded 100g samphire 100g pack of good salad leaf 1 good handful sorrel 1 good handful flat leaf parsley ½ a lemon ½ tsp of Dijon mustard olive oil pinch of brown sugar salt & pepper
Method:
Bring a pan of water to the boil for the samphire, do not season as it is salty enough and will retain most of its briny flavour. Blanch for 60 seconds in the water and transfer straight into ice cold water, this will help retain the colour and stop the cooking process. Remove when cool and drain. To make the dressing, whisk the juice of half a lemon with the mustard and a small pinch of sugar. Slowly add olive oil until the lemon mellows but isn't overpowered, 3-4 parts oil to juice is the general rule. Season to taste. Shred the sorrel roughly with a sharp knife and pick the leaves from the parsley. Now throw everything together in a big bowl and add the dressing as you see fit.
