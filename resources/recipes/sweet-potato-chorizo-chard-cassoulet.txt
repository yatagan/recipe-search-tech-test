Sweet potato, chorizo and chard cassoulet
Introduction:
This cassoulet contains all you need for a re-invigorating dinner: creamy white beans, tender, nutrient-rich sweet potato, robust greens and smoky-sweet chorizo. It only calls for one pan and it's quick enough for midweek. Make it vegetarian-friendly by leaving out the chorizo, though you make want to up the seasoning a little. 
Ingredients:
2 cooking chorizo sausages, cut into 1cm slices oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion or leek, finely sliced 700g sweet potatoes, peeled & chopped splash dry sherry (optional) 400ml passata (or use 200g tinned toms & 1 tbsp tom purée) 500ml veg stock or water 400g tin white beans, e.g. haricot, cannellini or butter beans leaves from 1 head chard, shredded handful fresh parsley or coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the chorizo in 2 tablespoons of oil for a few minutes on each side to colour them and release the paprika oils. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and keep to one side. Add the onion to the same pan, with a little more oil if needed, and cook slowly for 10 minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, chorizo, sherry, passata or chopped tomatoes and purée if using. Add the stock and season, then bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the beans and chard, then simmer for a further 5 minutes. Check the seasoning before serving.
