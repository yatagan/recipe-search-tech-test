Stir-fried oca with honey, soy and ginger
Introduction:
As you can eat oca raw or cooked, we have found that they can be at their best when half way between the two. They keep their sharp taste and have a water chestnut-like bite to them, perfect in any number of Asian stir-frys or noodle bowls. 
Ingredients:
350g oca, washed & scrubbed 1 tbsp sesame oil 4 spring onions, finely sliced 1 red chilli, finely sliced 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 1 tbsp runny honey
Method:
Cut the oca into halves or quarters, lengthways, depending on their size. Heat the oil in a wok or high-sided frying pan. Saut√© them on a medium-high heat for about 8 minutes. Keep them moving so they colour evenly. Add the onions & chilli and fry for another minute. Add the soy & ginger and toss together over the heat for about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and add the honey, mixing to coat well as it bubbles in the heat of the pan.
