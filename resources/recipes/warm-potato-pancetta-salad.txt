Warm potato and pancetta salad
Introduction:
Golden brown oven-roasted potatoes tossed with wedges of onion, rosemary and crisp, salty pancetta. Toss with rocket leaves for a warm salad, eat alongside chicken, or enjoy as an elegant starter. If you don't have pancetta this also works with bacon. Add a few cloves of garlic (or many) to the roasting tray if you like. 
Ingredients:
8 medium potatoes, scrubbed 2 red onions or shallots cut into wedges 3 rosemary sprigs olive oil 250g pancetta, cut into 1cm cubes 2-3 tbsp red wine or balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut the potatoes into halves or quarters if large, but leave whole if small. Cook in salted boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a roasting tin. Add the onion and rosemary sprigs. Toss in just enough oil to coat and season. Roast in for 45 minutes-1 hour, until the potatoes are cooked through, crisp and golden. Fry the pancetta in a little oil until crispy and browned. Add the red wine vinegar and stir well to get all the bits from the bottom of the pan. Toss with the potatoes.
