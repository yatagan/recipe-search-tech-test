Jerusalem artichokes in batter with salsa rossa
Introduction:
This makes an unusual and very delicious vegetarian snack. Spicy salsa rossa is an Italian classic: a versatile tomato sauce that also goes well with grilled meat and sausages, pasta and polenta and steamed, roasted or battered veg. 
Ingredients:
150g plain flour 2 tbsp olive oil 2 egg whites, stiffly whipped Jerusalem artichokes for the salsa rossa: 6 tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & diced 1 large red pepper, roasted, peeled & chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed Â½ red onion, finely chopped 1 tbsp capers, soaked in cold water for 20 mins, then squeezed dry & finely chopped 2 anchovies, finely chopped (optional) 1 red chilli, finely chopped 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Make a light batter by mixing the flour with the olive oil and enough lukewarm water to give the consistency of double cream. Leave to rest for 20 minutes. Just before use, fold in the stiffly whipped egg whites and some seasoning. Make the salsa rossa while the batter is resting: mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and season to taste. Dip 5mm-thick slices of Jerusalem artichoke in the batter, deep-fry them in oil and serve with salsa rossa.
