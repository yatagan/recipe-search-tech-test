Creamed corn with cumin and thyme
Introduction:
Rich, sweet and delicately herbed. This is really delicious eaten on buttery toast with a poached egg, and perhaps a crumbling of chorizo. It is also an excellent accompaniment to roast chicken. 
Ingredients:
4 sweetcorn cobs 50ml olive oil 1 large onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 6 sprigs of thyme ½ tsp cumin seeds 150ml dry white wine 250ml chicken or veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Stand each cob upright on a board and cut downwards with a sharp knife to remove the kernels. Heat oil in a small, heavy based pan and sauté the onion and garlic until lightly caramelised. Add the sweetcorn, thyme and cumin to the pan and sauté for several minutes until the ingredients start to catch on the pan base. Pour in the wine and stock, reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the corn is tender. Discard the thyme sprigs and set aside a large spoonful of corn. Blend the remaining amount for 2 minutes. Pass through a sieve, mix with the saved corn and season well.
