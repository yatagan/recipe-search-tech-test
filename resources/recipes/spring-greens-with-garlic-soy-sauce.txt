Spring greens with garlic and soy sauce
Introduction:
Spring greens are tender, full of flavour and packed with vitamins â€“ they almost taste of new life. This is a good, simple way to enjoy the best of their robust texture and zestiness. You may be tempted to add chilli, ginger or lemon, but try this first without. 
Ingredients:
2-4 tbsp sunflower oil 2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed with back of knife 2 small bunches spring greens, sliced crossways into 1cm strips soy sauce
Method:
Heat the oil over a high heat in a wok or a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan. Cook the garlic in the oil for about 20 seconds, adding the greens before the garlic browns. Cook for about 2 minutes, turning the greens constantly in the oil. Add 2 or 3 shakes of soy sauce, cook for a further 15 seconds and serve immediately.
