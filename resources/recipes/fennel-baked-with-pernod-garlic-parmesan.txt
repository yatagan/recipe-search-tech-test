Fennel baked with Pernod, garlic and Parmesan
Introduction:
Parmesan and fennel make a soft and flavoursome combination in this quick, oven-baked dish, whilst the garlic adds a bit of a kick. Pernod is optional, but its anise flavour is very good with fennel. Try this with baked eggs, roasted chicken or fish. If you'd like to make it vegetarian, use another hard cheese in place of Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
2-3 fennel bulbs, trimmed & quartered or cut into 6ths if large large knob of butter 1 garlic clove, very finely chopped 2-3 tbsp Pernod or Ricard 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Boil or steam fennel in salted water until just tender – don’t overcook, and be sure to drain fennel very well. Butter a gratin dish. Arrange fennel in the dish and scatter over garlic. Dot with remaining butter, pour over alcohol, season with salt and lots of pepper and finally scatter with Parmesan. Bake for about 15 minutes or until Parmesan is golden and fennel juices are bubbling.
