Celeriac and apple mash
Introduction:
To make this mash sharper, exchange the double cream for sour cream or crème fraîche, or add in a little blue cheese. This goes with duck, pheasant or pork tenderloin, alongside braised red cabbage. 
Ingredients:
1 large dessert apple, peeled, cored & finely sliced 1 large celeriac, peeled & cut into quarters 1 large potato, peeled & cut into quarters 3 tbsp double cream 30g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the apple in a pan with about a tablespoon of water until soft and broken down. Cook the celeriac and potato in boiling salted water until tender, then drain well. Mix with the apple and pass through your finest sieve. Heat up the cream and butter in a small pan and stir them into the mash. Reheat gently, if necessary, season to taste and serve.
