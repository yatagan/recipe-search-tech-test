3 tbsp rice wine vinegar 1 tsp soy sauce 1 tsp sesame oil ½ tsp wasabi ½ tsp toasted sesame seeds, crushed in a pestle & mortar ½ tsp sugar 1 pinch of cayenne pepper ½ tsp miso paste ½ tsp fresh ginger, grated 1 tbsp carrot, grated 1 tbsp chives, chopped
Method:
Blend all of the ingredients (except the chives) together until smooth, then stir in the chives. That’s it!
