Saffron poached chicken with cauliflower couscous
Introduction:
Cauliflower couscous is light, fluffy and made in minutes. It can often be used in place of rice or other grains and is especially good for gluten-free eating. It's mild nuttiness works brilliantly with tender poached chicken in this light meal. 
Ingredients:
½ tsp saffron threads 2 carrots, roughly chopped 1 stick celery, roughly chopped 2 bay leaves 2 chicken breasts, skin removed for the couscous: 1 cauliflower, outer leaves removed, cut into florets 1 garlic clove, crushed large bunch of parsley, finely chopped large bunch of mint leaves, finely chopped 100g pine nuts, toasted in a dry frying pan until golden 200g dates, pitted & chopped 1 tbsp sherry or good white wine vinegar juice of 1 lemon 3 tbsp good olive oil 1 tbsp honey, more to taste 100g salad leaves
Method:
Put the saffron, carrot, celery and bay leaves in a saucepan. Add the chicken and enough water to completely cover it. Simmer for about 20-25 minutes or so, depending on size, until cooked through. Leave to cool in the pan, then take the chicken out and thinly slice. Pulse the cauliflower in a food processor until it looks like couscous (or grate it, if you don’t have a processor). As an optional extra, fry it off in a little oil for 1-2 mins until lightly toasted, then leave to cool, or use raw. Transfer to a large bowl. Mix in the garlic, herbs, pine nuts and dates. Season. Whisk together the vinegar, lemon, oil and honey and mix into the cauliflower. Toss in the chicken. Taste and adjust the seasoning, honey, lemon and oil if needed. Serve with the salad leaves.
