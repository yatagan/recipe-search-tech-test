Coconut spiced summer greens 
Introduction:
This quick, flavourful way with summer greens might seem to have a lot of ingredients, but you should have most of them in the cupboard. To make it into a main course, add noodles and shredded cooked chicken or fried tofu. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp mustard seeds 2 green chillies, finely chopped 2cm piece fresh ginger, grated ½ tsp turmeric 400g summer greens, tough stalks cut out, leaves shredded 1 tbsp soy sauce juice of 1 lime or a small lemon ½ tsp ground coriander 1 bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped 2 tbsp desiccated coconut, toasted in a dry frying pan until just golden
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan. Fry the cumin and mustard seeds for 30 seconds, then add the chilli, ginger and turmeric. Fry for 1 minute, then add the greens, soy and a splash of water. Cover the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the greens have wilted. Add the lemon or lime juice, ground coriander, half the fresh coriander and half the coconut, then toss everything together. Serve scattered with the rest of the coconut and coriander.
