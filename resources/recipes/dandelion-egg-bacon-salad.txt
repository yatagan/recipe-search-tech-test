Dandelion, egg and bacon salad with a warm vinaigrette
Introduction:
This is a classic French salad. Salty, rich and bitter. It is usually made with curly endive but is ideal with any bitter leaf. The warm vinaigrette is made by adding to the fat leftover from cooking the bacon, you can just make a standard vinaigrette if this seems a little too indulgent. To you can lengthen this from a starter to a lunch by adding a few warm boiled potatoes, coarsely diced. You could poach your eggs instead and serve them with a runny yolk if the fancy takes you.
Ingredients:
2 eggs 4 rashers of streaky or 80g of diced pancetta, diced 150g dandelion leaves, washed 1 shallot or Â½ red onion, very finely diced 2 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard
Method:
Tear any large leaves into smaller more manageable pieces. Detach and discard any stalks that look particularly large and tough. Pop the eggs in a pan of cold water bring them gently to the boil. Cook them for exactly 6 minutes from the point the water reaches a steady rolling boil. In the meantime fry the bacon in a little oil until golden and starting to crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon. Let the bacon fat cool a little. Give the eggs a few firm taps to break the shell, gently remove it. Add the shallot, vinegar and mustard to the bacon fat. Mix together adding enough oil to lengthen it into a sharp, salty dressing. Throw the crispy bacon and dandelion leaves in the dressing. Divide between 2 plates, cut the eggs into wedges and serve them on top with a grind of black pepper and pinch of sea salt.
