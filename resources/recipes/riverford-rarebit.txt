Riverford rarebit
Introduction:
This has been a regular in Ben Watson's household since he thought it up at the 2009 Real Food Show. Serve bubbling and golden with some green veg on the side and call it dinner. The secret is to make sure the bread's a little dry so it keeps some crunch and the cheese stays on top. For something a bit more tangy, use blue cheese instead of Cheddar – this is also good for vegetarian's wanting to keep up the punch but leave out the chorizo. 
Ingredients:
a little oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 3 leeks, finely chopped 2 skinless chorizo sausages, diced (the skins will peel off if you dip the sausage in cold water) 4 slices sourdough, workers white, or malted bloomer bread a few slices Cheddar.
Method:
In a frying pan with a little oil (you won’t need much as the chorizo will provide some fat) sauté the finely chopped leeks and a couple of diced skinless chorizo. Toast four slices of workers white, malted bloomer or, even better, sourdough and place on a baking tray. Cover with finely sliced strong, dry Cheddar. Slicing seems to work better than grating. Put in a hot oven or under a not too fierce grill until the cheese has melted. Spread on the leek and chorizo combo and grill/bake for another five minutes. If you are the proud owner of anything akin to a George Foreman grill you can scoop some of the crumb out of a bap and replace with the mix. Give it five minutes with the lid down for a crunchy Panini/toastie.
