Summer root veg gratin
Introduction:
This tender and creamy summer root veg gratin makes a very easy vegetarian main – and doubly so if you've got a mandolin or food processor to slice your veg nice and thin. Eat it just with a crisp green salad, or alternatively as side to a fuller spread of chicken or sausages. 
Ingredients:
300g new potatoes, scrubbed & thinly sliced 300g bunched carrots (leafy tops removed), scrubbed or peeled & thinly sliced 300g summer turnips (leafy tops removed), peeled & thinly sliced 200ml crème fraîche 200ml chicken or veg stock 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped, plus a little extra for sprinkling 50g Parmesan or Pecorino, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. In a large bowl, mix the veg with the crème fraîche, stock and parsley. Season well. Spread the mixture into a gratin dish. Cover with foil and bake in the oven for 45-50 minutes, until the veg is just tender. Remove the foil, sprinkle over the cheese and bake until the cheese has melted and turned a golden colour. Sprinkle with a little extra fresh parsley to serve.
