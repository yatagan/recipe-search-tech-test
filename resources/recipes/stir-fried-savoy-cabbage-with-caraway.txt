Savoy cabbage is as good for a quick midweek meal as it is for a Sunday roast. Adding a few caraway seeds gives it an interesting flavour and goes particularly well with pork.

Method:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok to a medium heat. Add the cabbage and caraway seeds and stir-fry for about 5 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted. Season and stir in a knob of butter to serve.
