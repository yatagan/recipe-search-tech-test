Quesadillas
Introduction:
A great, family-friendly Mexican dish in between a stuffed pancake and a toasted sandwich. This is a delicious, easy and almost instant meal that goes down well with nearly everyone. 
Ingredients:
200g Gruy√®re or emmental, grated 150g feta, crumbled 1 red pepper, diced 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 1 tsp fresh mint, chopped (optional) 2 cooked sweetcorn cobs, kernels removed 1 tbsp onion, finely chopped chillies, finely chopped (optional) 1 tsp balsamic vinegar 8 corn or wheat tortillas 25g butter olive oil
Method:
Mix the cheeses, red pepper, herbs, sweetcorn kernels, onion, chopped chillies and balsamic vinegar together in a large bowl. Place the tortillas on a clean surface. Add a good heaped tablespoon of the mixture to the centre of each tortilla and fold to enclose the filling. Heat the butter and a little oil in a frying pan and fry the quesadillas on each side for a few minutes until the filling melts and the tortillas start to brown.
