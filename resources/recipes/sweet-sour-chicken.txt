Sweet and sour chicken
Introduction:
Tender strips of pan-fried chicken in a sweet and tangy sauce. This homemade version of China's wildly popular sweet and sour chicken has no takeaway nasties and makes a lovely dinner. Serve this dish with brown rice noodles or rice.

2 tbsp olive oil 2 skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips 1 carrot, peeled & cut into strips 1 red pepper, deseeded & cut into strips 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp fresh ginger, peeled & grated 1 tbsp cornflour 3 tbsp soy sauce 3 tbsp water & 200ml extra 1 tbsp light brown sugar 1 tbsp rice or white wine vinegar Â½ small pineapple, peeled & cut into chunks large handful beansprouts (optional), or try using some of our mixed sprouted seeds
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan, then add the chicken and fry until lightly browned on both sides. Add the carrot, pepper, garlic and ginger. Fry for another couple of minutes. In a small bowl, mix the cornflour, soy, 3 tablespoons of water, plus the sugar and vinegar, and add it to the chicken along with the pineapple. Add a further 200ml of water, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for another couple of minutes, making sure that the chicken is cooked through (no pink juices).
