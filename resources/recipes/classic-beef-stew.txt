Classic beef stew
Introduction:
There's little to beat this sumptuous beef stew for dinner on a cold evening. It's even better made a day ahead so that the flavour has time to develop. Serve with buttery cabbage and mashed potato or thickly buttered crusty brown bread. 
Ingredients:
800g braising beef or stewing steak, cut into chunks 3 tbsp seasoned flour olive oil 200g bacon, cut into lardons ½ large celeriac, cut into chunks 2 carrots, cut into chunks 100g shallots, peeled &, if large, cut in half 2 bay leaves thyme sprigs 300g chestnut mushrooms, cut in half if large 1 tsp tomato purée 500ml red wine 300ml beef or chicken stock handful fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Toss the beef in the flour. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a casserole dish or heavy-bottomed, ovenproof saucepan and brown the beef briefly in batches, then set it aside. Fry the bacon for 2-3 minutes in the casserole. Add the celeriac and carrot with the shallots, bay leaves and thyme. Cook for 5 minutes until beginning to soften, then stir in the mushrooms and tomato purée and cook for a few minutes more. Pour in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Add the stock and bring to the boil, then simmer for a few minutes. Add the beef, stir thoroughly, then put the lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 2-3 hours, until tender. Check seasoning and scatter with parsley before serving.
