Durban beef curry
Introduction:
One of the oldest and largest ex-patriot Indian communities is in Durban, South Africa. Workers from the sub-continent have been there for over 250 years so the Durban curry has a bit of history as the forerunner to the chicken tikka masala type curries we know and love. It works equally well with any meat, including turkey and venison. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, sliced into rings 3 curry leaves 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp fresh ginger, finely grated 1 tsp curry masala 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander ⅓ cinnamon stick 3 cardamom pods ½ tsp ground turmeric 500g diced beef 2 small chillies, finely chopped (less if you don’t like it too hot) 2 medium tomatoes, chopped 200ml stock 1 tbsp tomato purée 3 medium potatoes 1 small cauliflower, broken into florets salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onion and curry leaves until the onion is soft and golden brown. Stir in the garlic, ginger and spices and cook for a couple of minutes over a medium heat. Add the beef and chillies, stirring well for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, half the stock and cook for about 10 minutes, before adding the tomato purée. Add the potatoes, cauliflower and remaining stock, and simmer gently for 1 hour. Remove the cinnamon, cardamom and curry leaves, and adjust the seasoning if necessary before serving.
