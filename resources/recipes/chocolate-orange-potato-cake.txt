Chocolate and orange potato cake
Introduction:
Moist and flavourful, this cake goes well with afternoon tea, or as a dessert with a trickle of cream. Mashed potatoes are great trick for achieving a softer cake – just don't add them to the mixture until they're completely cool or they will weigh it down. 
Ingredients:
120g potatoes, peeled, boiled & mashed 175g butter 225g demerara sugar 3 eggs, beaten 110g plain chocolate, melted grated rind & juice of 1 orange 30g cocoa powder 225g self-raising flour
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4 and grease and line a 24cm cake tin. In a large bowl cream the mashed potato, butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and gradually stir in the melted chocolate and juice and rind of an orange. Lightly fold in the cocoa powder and flour and pour the mixture into the cake tin. Bake in the centre of the oven for 30-40 minutes.
