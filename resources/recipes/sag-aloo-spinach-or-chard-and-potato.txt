Sag aloo (spinach or chard and potato)
Introduction:
Sag aloo makes a great vegetarian weeknight dinner with rice, yoghurt raita and pickles. You can add bulk and protein by stirring in some drained tinned chickpeas towards the end of cooking. It's also great with meat as part of a wider Indian spread. 
Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped 2 large potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes or smaller 400g spinach or chard, stalks removed, coarsely chopped 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated 1/2 tsp garlic clove, coarsely chopped 1/4 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp garam masala olive oil butter
Method:
Fry the cumin seeds in a heavy bottomed pan in the oil and butter until just starting to brown. Add the onion and fry until starting to brown. Add the potato, garlic, turmeric, ginger and garam masala, then fry until starting to soften. Add the spinach or chard and cook until it collapses over the potato. Salt to taste.
