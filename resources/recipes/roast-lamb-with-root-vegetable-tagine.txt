Roast lamb with root vegetable tagine
Introduction:
This pomegranate and apricot enriched root veg stew makes a great partner for lamb in virtually any form, from roast to kofta or merguez meatballs. It’s hearty and warming and just the thing for a cold winter evening. It’s great served with couscous and tzatziki on the side.
Ingredients:
1.35kg lamb joint, seasoned well 2 onions 4 garlic cloves 3 sticks celery 4 carrots 75ml olive oil 800g roots (a mix of any/all of swede, turnip, celeriac, squash, parsnip) ½ tsp ground ginger 1 tsp turmeric 125g unsulphured organic apricots (worth it for the extra depth of flavour) 2x400g tins chopped tomatoes 1 generous tbsp harissa (with mint, coriander, cumin, caraway & chilli) 750ml chicken stock 2x400g tins cooked chickpeas 1 pomegranate 2 tbsp coriander, chopped
Method:
Set the oven to 170°C/Gas Mark 3½ and cook the lamb for about 90 minutes. Roughly chop the onions, garlic, celery and halve the carrots and blitz in a food processor. Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy casserole dish, add the blitzed veg and gently sauté for 10 minutes. Peel and dice (1½-2cm) the remaining veg and add to the pan. Add the ginger and turmeric, stir and sauté for another 5 minutes. Cut the apricots into slivers and add to the casserole with the tomatoes, harissa and stock. Put the lid on and cook gently until the vegetables are nearly cooked. Drain the chickpeas and add to the pan. Cook for another 10 minutes. Deseed the pomegranate by cutting it in half, flattening the skin and tapping the outside with a wooden spoon over a bowl. Add the seeds to the stew, keeping a few back for garnish. Add the chopped coriander and serve with slices of lamb, yoghurt or tzatziki.
