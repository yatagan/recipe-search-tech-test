Mini pepper and sweetcorn tarts
Introduction:
These crisp, light and summery mini tarts are very easy to make. They're good warm or cold, eaten for anything from a vegetarian dinner party starter to a picnic canapé or packed lunch treat. You can vary the cheese – this also works well with goat's cheese, Cheddar or Parmesan. 
Ingredients:
1 sheet or block (320g) all-butter puff pastry, rolled out to 3-4mm 1 corn cob 1 small red pepper, finely diced 50g double Gloucester, grated 2 tbsp fresh chives, finely chopped 2 eggs, beaten 150ml crème fraîche ½ tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Lightly grease two muffin tins (or cook them in two batches if you only have one tin). Use a 6cm round pastry cutter to cut out circles from the pastry. Gather up the off-cuts and re-roll them to make enough circles. Put them in the tins. Prick the pastry a couple of times with a fork. Cut the kernels from the corn and put in a bowl with the pepper, cheese and chives in a large bowl. Season. In another bowl, mix the eggs, crème fraîche and mustard. Divide the pepper and corn mixture evenly between the pastry cases. Carefully pour over the egg mixture. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden and set. Leave to cool a little in the tin, then serve warm or cold.
