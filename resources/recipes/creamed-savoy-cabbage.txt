Creamed Savoy cabbage
Introduction:
This simple, creamy, almost instant vegetarian recipe goes well with most main dishes. There's no need to be too exact with the proportions – try omitting the carrots and celeriac and adding in a few cloves of garlic for a different effect. For a lighter, tangier finish, use crème fraîche instead of cream. 
Ingredients:
2 large carrots, diced ½ celeriac, peeled & diced 1 Savoy cabbage, quartered, core removed, & shredded 275ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch the carrots and celeriac in boiling salted water for 2 minutes. Remove and refresh in iced water. Blanch cabbage for 1 minute and refresh. In a large saucepan, reduce the cream by half, then mix in vegetables. Season to taste and cook for 1-2 minutes.
