Salt & Pepper Squid
Introduction:
This is a classic Chinese restaurant dish, easy to put together if you feel safe and confident deep-frying at home. The chilli, onion & garlic are crispy little garnishes that cook and crisp up in less than a minute.
Ingredients:
400g squid ½ tbsp black peppercorns ½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns 1 tbsp flaked sea salt 25g cornflour 25g plain flour 2 red chillies, sliced 3 spring onions, sliced 4 garlic cloves, sliced 1 lemon
Method:
Cut open the white squid bodies and lightly score the inside flesh with a criss-cross pattern; cut them into 3cm triangle shapes. Divide the tentacles. Coarsely grind the peppercorns in a pepper mill or pestle and mortar. Mix them with the salt and flours in a shallow bowl. In a deep saucepan, heat 2 inches of sunflower oil to 190˚C. Dredge the squid in the seasoned flour and shake away the excess. Deep fry the squid for 2 minutes, until lightly coloured. Throw in the chillies, onions and garlic and fry for a final 30 seconds, or until the garlic is golden brown. You might want to do this in batches. Remove everything with a slotted spoon and serve immediately with wedges of lemon for squeezing.
