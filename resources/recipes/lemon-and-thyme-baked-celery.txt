Lemon and thyme baked celery
Introduction:
This easy celery gratin recipe is creamy but light and deliciously imbued with aromatic thyme. It can be served as an accompaniment – it's good with chicken and fish – but it also makes a good weeknight main with a pile of fragrant brown rice. Sprinkle with breadcrumbs before baking for a bit of extra crunch. 
Ingredients:
25g butter, & a little extra for greasing 1 head celery, trimmed & cut into 4-5cm lengths 300ml veg stock zest of ½ & juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp double cream 2 egg yolks leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme ¼ nutmeg, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Lightly grease a gratin or baking dish. Melt the butter in a large pan. Add the celery and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the stock to the celery with the lemon zest and juice. Let it bubble away for about 10 minutes, until all but 4 tablespoons of the liquid remains. Transfer the mixture to the gratin dish. Mix the cream and egg yolks together. Stir in the thyme and nutmeg, season and pour over the celery. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the celery is tender.
