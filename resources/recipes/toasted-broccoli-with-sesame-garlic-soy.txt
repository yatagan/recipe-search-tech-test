Toasted broccoli with sesame, garlic and soy
Introduction:
Chargrilled broccoli showered with crunchy toasted sesame seeds, salty soy sauce and piquant garlic. This is tasty enough to be stirred into a bowl of quinoa and eaten as a light and healthy vegetarian lunch. Try it with purple sprouting broccoli if you have this in your box. 
Ingredients:
2 tsp sesame seeds 600g broccoli 3-4 tbsp olive oil 3 garlic cloves, finely sliced 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped (optional) soy sauce, to finish few drops sesame oil (optional)
Method:
Toast the sesame seeds in a small dry pan until golden and keep aside. Cut the broccoli into smallish sprigs of similar size – slice big ones in half lengthways. Peel the stalks and cut into batons. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, blanch the broccoli for one minute, and drain When cool, pour a little olive oil onto your hands and rub over the broccoli, so it is coated but not actually oily. Heat your heavy frying pan or griddle until it is really hot – a drop of water should sizzle furiously. Add the broccoli pieces. You are aiming to scorch them slightly, so turn them once they have darkened (tongs are ideal) and toast the other side, then remove to a serving dish. In a small pan, heat the remaining oil and add the garlic. Fry gently until the garlic turns golden but do not let it burn. Add the chilli towards the end of cooking, if using. Shake some soy sauce and a few drops of sesame oil (if using) over the broccoli, along with half the garlic and half the sesame, and shake or stir to coat. Sprinkle the remaining garlic and sesame over the broccoli to garnish and serve.
