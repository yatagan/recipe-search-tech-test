Rhubarb and pistachio baklava
Introduction:
This honey and nut dessert is sweet and sticky. Rhubarb adds welcome sharpness. A little goes a long way - serve in tiny pieces with coffee or as an al fresco pudding. 
Ingredients:
250g rhubarb (about 3 sticks), sliced into very thin 2mm slices 200g shelled pistachios, finely chopped 150g golden caster sugar 1 orange 1 pack ready-made filo pastry 150g unsalted butter, melted 200ml runny (clear) honey splash orange flower water (optional)
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Put the rhubarb, pistachios and sugar in a bowl. Finely grate in the zest of half the orange. Mix together. Lay the filo out flat on your work surface. Dampen a clean tea towel and lay it on top, to stop the pastry drying out. Cut the pastry across the narrower width into 3 equal sections. Brush each layer of the first third with some of the melted butter, laying the sheets on top of each other in a small (about 25x15cm) baking dish or tray as you go. Spread over half the rhubarb mixture. Repeat the brushing and layering of filo, then the rest of the rhubarb, then top with a final layer of filo. Use a very sharp knife to cut right through the baklava, across each way to make a small diagonal pattern. Bake for 40-45 minutes, depending on your oven, until crispy and golden. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely. Gently warm the honey and juice from half the orange in a small pan. Add a splash of orange flower water (add sparingly - it’s strong). Pour evenly over the baklava and leave to cool at room temperature, then chill in the fridge overnight. Serve cut in the small diagonal pieces.
