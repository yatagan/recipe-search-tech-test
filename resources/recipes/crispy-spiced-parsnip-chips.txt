Crispy spiced parsnip chips
Introduction:
Slightly fiddly, but utterly delicious, these parsnips chips are a good alternative to ordinary chips – both healthier and with a more interesting nutty taste. They're good as a dip, or as a side – epecially with strong-tasting meat from lamb to duck or pheasant. 
Ingredients:
a few tbsp sunflower oil 100g seasoned plain flour 2 eggs 70g Parmesan, grated 70g breadcrumbs 3 tsp ground cumin ½-¾ tsp cayenne, depending on how spicy you like things 400g parsnips (about 4 small or 2 large), peeled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Pour a generous layer of oil into a large baking tray and put to heat in the oven. Prepare the crisp coating by placing the seasoned flour in a large clean plastic bag. Beat the eggs in a large, wide bowl. In another bowl, combine Parmesan, breadcrumbs, cumin and cayenne. Add some salt and pepper. Turn out crumbs onto a large plate or tray. Cut the parsnips into batons a couple of centimetres thick - aim for the look of large chips. Put the parsnip batons in the flour, hold the bag closed, and shake. The parsnips will be coated in a thin layer of flour. Pick out the floured parsnips, and using a fork, roll in the egg to coat. Then lift the parsnips out of the egg and roll each piece in the breadcrumb mix. Once all the parsnips are ready, place them carefully in a single layer on the hot oiled oven tray, turn gently to coat in oil all over and roast for 25-30 minutes until parsnips are soft and the crumb coating is crisp and golden. Turn out onto kitchen paper, then serve.
