Soufflé vegetable pancakes
Introduction:
Vegetarian stuffed pancakes cooked in a hot oven until the cheese on top is melting and golden brown. Quick to make and light and airy, these make a good midweek dinner and are an excellent way of using up leftover veg. See our basic pancake mix for a simple recipe. 
Ingredients:
about 400g leftover cooked veg e.g. leeks, roots or broccoli, finely chopped 50g butter 50g plain flour 300ml milk ½ tsp Dijon or coarse grain mustard handful grated Cheddar (or use whatever cheese you have left in the fridge) & a little extra for sprinkling 4 eggs, yolks & whites separated 4 pancakes salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Melt the butter in a pan, add the flour and cook gently, stirring, for 2 minutes. Lower the heat right down and gradually whisk in the milk. Increase the heat slightly and stir until the sauce has thickened. Add the mustard and cheese and season with salt and pepper. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then stir in the egg yolks, then the leftover veg. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form a soft peak. Carefully fold the egg whites into the veg mixture. Put the pancakes in a baking dish and spoon some of the veg mixture down the middle of each pancake. Fold the pancake over on both sides to make an open ended parcel. Sprinkle with a little extra cheese and bake for 20 minutes.
