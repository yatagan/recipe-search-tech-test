Pork leg roast with red cabbage
Introduction:
These days braised red cabbage is considered very seventies, but like chicken Kiev it’s due for a revival. With its sweet and sour taste, it is often a surprising hit with children. It also keeps well, so make double and enjoy the rest with some sausages later in the week. 
Ingredients:
1kg pork leg 1 large onion, finely chopped 50g lard, goose fat, beef dripping or butter 1 red cabbage, quartered, cored & shredded 3 tbsp cider vinegar 2 tbsp dark brown sugar 250ml stock 2 Bramley apples, grated 1 tbsp flour 4 tbsp crème fraîche 1 tsp English mustard powder.
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas Mark 6. Score the pork fat with a sharp knife and pat dry with kitchen paper. Cook the joint for 45 minutes and then at 180°C/Gas 4 for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn up the temperature to maximum. Peel off the crackling using a sharp knife (take care as it will be hot - use a carving fork or clean tea towel to hold it) and put it back in the oven until it is really blistered. Meanwhile, cover the meat and leave it to rest. The cabbage can be done in advance of cooking the pork. In a heavy saucepan, gently sauté the onion in the fat for 10 minutes, add the cabbage, vinegar, sugar and stock, put the lid on and cook in a 140°C/Gas Mark 1 oven for 2 hours. Remove and stir in the grated apple. In a large bowl, mix the flour with the crème fraîche and mustard powder. Mix in the red cabbage (1 ladle at a time). Return it all to the saucepan and cook on the hob for another 10 minutes (more if it has cooled down) over a gentle heat. Check the seasoning - hopefully the acidity of the grated apple will come through - and the cabbage will be lusciously creamy. Serve with the roast joint and cracking.
