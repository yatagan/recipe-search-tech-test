Spiced beef
Introduction:
Start this recipe a week in advance – it calls for a long marinade. Spiced beef is always a hit at Christmas, but try slow roasting it on a barbecue for something altogether different. It's good with a simple potato gratin and a lightly dressed salad, or with mash, cabbage and mustard. Or let it cool and slice it thin for sandwiches. For a more Italian approach, see our recipe for bresaola. 
Ingredients:
1kg beef joint 100g dark brown sugar 50g each of cracked peppercorns (pink ones will be particularly good), allspice & juniper berries 5g ground cinnamon 80g salt
Method:
Rub the dry ingredients into the beef. Place it in a plastic zip-lock bag and refrigerate in a bowl for 1 week, turning daily. Preheat oven to 140ºC/Gas 1. Rinse off any excess spices, pat dry and place in a casserole dish (with lid) and add a glass of water. Cover the pan with a double layer of foil, fitting it tightly over the pan to prevent any evaporation and put on the lid. Cook in the oven for 3-4 hours. Remove from the oven and cool for 2 hours with the lid on. You can either eat it immediately (try with mash, cabbage, mustard and the broth), or wrap it in foil and film and press under a bag of sugar overnight.
