Stuffed tomatoes
Introduction:
These easy-to-make baked stuffed tomatoes could be eaten as a side or appetiser. To keep then vegetarian replace the Parmesan with another hard cheese. If you'd like to make a gluten-free version, the breadcrumbs could be replaced with cooked quinoa. Another good adaptation would be to add chopped olives or anchovies and crumbled feta. 
Ingredients:
4 beef tomatoes 100g slightly stale breadcrumbs (use crusts as well) 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped generous handful fresh parsley, finely chopped 1 tbsp capers, roughly chopped 5 tbsp olive oil 50g Parmesan, freshly grated salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the stalks of the tomatoes, and cut each tomato in half horizontally. Scoop out the insides and reserve. Leave the tomato shells upside-down to drain for 15 minutes or so. Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Mix the breadcrumbs with the garlic, parsley, capers and about 3 tablespoons of the juicy bit of the insides of the tomatoes, breaking up any large lumps of flesh. Season and mix in just enough of the olive oil to moisten - about 3 tablespoons. Stuff the tomatoes with this mixture and sit in an oiled baking dish. Sprinkle over the Parmesan, then drizzle over a final 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Bake for about 20 minutes, until lightly browned and sizzling. Serve hot or warm.
