Pork mince pasta sauce
Introduction:
Minced beef is good – but minced pork is better. It lightens things up, which seems to bring out the individual flavours of this dish. It’s a fantastic match for pasta with garlic, fennel seed and a little chilli (à la The River Café). We serve it with a fresh green salad on the side. 
Ingredients:
400g minced pork 1 tsp fennel seeds oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 red onions, chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 2 dried chillies, crumbled 2 bay leaves 250ml red wine 2 tins chopped tomatoes pinch nutmeg, grated handful Parmesan, grated 250ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Mix the minced pork with the fennel seeds and seasoning and fry in a flameproof casserole dish with olive oil, keeping it on the move, for five minutes. Add the red onions, garlic, chilli and bay leaves, and fry gently for 30 minutes. Turn up the heat and add the red wine. Keep stirring for a couple of minutes and then add the chopped tomatoes. Bring the whole lot to the boil and allow some of the liquid to evaporate. Reduce to a gentle simmer, put on a lid and cook for an hour. Add the nutmeg, Parmesan and double cream. Stir until everything is incorporated and check the seasoning.
