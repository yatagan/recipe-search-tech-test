Courgette and lamb meatballs
Introduction:
The unusual inclusion of courgette gives these meatballs a lovely flavour and texture â€“ and they're surprisingly quick to make. Eat with a salad for a light lunch, or with couscous or spaghetti for something a little heartier. Peperonata, tomato and pepper sauce, is an excellent accompaniment. 
Ingredients:
500g courgettes, peeled 30ml olive oil 1 medium onion, skinned & finely chopped 1 garlic clove, skinned & crushed 500g lamb, minced & pounded 50g feta cheese, grated 1 tbsp fresh mint 1 egg plain flour oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the courgettes in half, lengthways, sprinkle with salt and leave for one hour. Rinse thoroughly, squeeze and then grate them. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and gently cook until softened, not brown. Add the garlic and the courgette and cook gently for about 10-25 minutes, until tender. Remove from the heat and cool then mix with the meat, cheese, mint and egg. Season with salt and pepper, then pound until pasty. Form into little balls, and roll quickly in flour. Heat a little oil, enough to cover the surface of the frying pan, until nearly smoking, then, on a low heat, cook the meatballs for 10-15 minutes, turning frequently until golden on the outside and cooked through.
