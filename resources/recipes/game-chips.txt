Game chips
Introduction:
Crispy game chips are so-called because they were traditionally eaten as a side to roasted game birds or strong tasting meat like venison. This is a good way to just up root veg odds and ends from your veg box, and works just as well as a snack or a side to roast chicken. 
Ingredients:
Any root veg - parsnips, beetroot, sweet potato, ordinary potatoes, celeriac, Jerusalem artichokes oil for deep frying, e.g. groundnut or sunflower
Method:
Peel the veg, then slice with a swivel peeler or mandolin into thin slices. Soak in cold water for half an hour. Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Heat 500ml groundnut or sunflower oil in a saucepan, making sure the pan is less than half full. Test the temperature by throwing in one slice - it should cook within a minute. Dry the slices on kitchen roll, then cook the chips in batches, removing them with a slotted spoon as they begin to brown. Remove each batch to a baking tray in the oven to crisp up, then serve with the venison and some jelly.
