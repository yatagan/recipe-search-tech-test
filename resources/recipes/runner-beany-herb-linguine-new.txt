Runner beany herb linguine
Introduction:
This is a good, simple, light pasta for warmer days, combining runner beans with generous quantities of parsley, dill, mint and lemon. Use Pecorino in place of Parmesan for vegetarians. This goes well with a bowl of mixed salad leaves, dotted with edible flowers from the garden if you have any (nasturtiums, marigolds, pansies, chive flowers). 
Ingredients:
200g linguine or spaghetti 250g runner beans, trimmed & stringed, finely sliced on the diagonal 1 garlic clove, crushed finely grated zest & juice of ½ a lemon, more to taste 2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for drizzling handful parsley leaves, chopped handful dill, chopped handful mint leaves, chopped 50g Parmesan, finely grated
Method:
Boil the linguine in a large pan of salted boiling water for 10 minutes. Add the beans and cook for a further 2 minutes. As soon as the beans go in, put the garlic, lemon zest and juice in frying pan. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and gently warm for 1 minute (don’t let the garlic burn). Remove from the heat. Drain the pasta and beans, keeping a ladle of the cooking water. Add the pasta and beans to the frying pan, with three quarters of the fresh herbs, half the grated cheese and a little of the reserved pasta water. Season and toss gently to combine. Taste and add a little more lemon juice or seasoning if needed. Divide between 2 pasta bowls. Sprinkle over the rest of the herbs and cheese to serve.
