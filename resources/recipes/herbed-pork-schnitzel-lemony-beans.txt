Herbed pork schnitzel and lemony beans
Introduction:
A simple, elegant dinner dish of pork steaks beaten thin and coated in crisp golden breadcrumbs. You could make this with flattened chicken breasts instead of pork if you like. Try using other green beans instead of French beans if you have them in your veg box, or even griddled or fried courgettes, or a mixture of both. 
Ingredients:
4 thin boneless pork steaks (escalopes) 3 tbsp plain flour 2 eggs splash of milk (about 1 tbsp) 150g stale white breadcrumbs (or use Japanese panko breadcrumbs for a very crispy texture) 6 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 3 tbsp Parmesan, finely grated zest of 1 lemon oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 250g French beans, topped & tailed juice of ½ lemon 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Using the end of a rolling pin or meat mallet, bash the pork until it is as thin as you can get it – about ½cm is fine. Take three shallow dishes and place the flour with some salt and pepper in one, the eggs whisked with the milk in another and the breadcrumbs, mixed with the herbs, cheese and lemon rind in the third. Dip the pork first in the flour, then the egg, then the breadcrumbs, to coat. Heat about 4-5 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan, and fry the schnitzel on both sides for about 5 minutes, or until the pork is cooked through and the breadcrumbs golden. Cook in batches if your pan isn’t big enough to hold them all, and keep warm in the oven. To make the beans, boil them in a pan of salted water for about 5 minutes, until cooked but still squeaky. Drain and toss with the lemon juice, oil and parsley to serve.
