Sausages and roasted root veg couscous
Introduction:
Little could be simpler than this hearty autumnal dish: throw the sausages and whatever root veg you have in your veg box into a baking tray and roast them, then serve over fluffy couscous. For a vegetarian dinner omit the sausages or use a vegetarian variety. 
Ingredients:
400g sausages mixed root veg, e.g. ½ a swede, 2 large parsnips, 2 carrots, peeled & chopped into similar bite sized pieces olive oil 200g couscous hot veg stock 20g butter small handful fresh herbs e.g. parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Prick the sausages and toss with the the veg in a baking dish in just enough olive oil to coat. Season and bake in the oven until just tender (about 30 minutes). 5 minutes before the sausages and veg are ready, put the couscous in a large bowl and pour over just enough hot stock to cover. Leave to stand for 5 minutes. Add a knob of butter to the couscous and stir well to melt the butter and separate the grains of couscous. Remove the sausages and veg from the oven. Cut the sausages into bite size pieces (or leave whole) and mix with the roast veg and couscous. Add the chopped fresh herbs if using.
