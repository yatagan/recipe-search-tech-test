Minced pork Sloppy Joes
Introduction:
'Obviously minced beef is the normal filling for a Sloppy Joe, but with all that ketchup and barbecue sauce, I challenge anyone to tell the difference. I have to confess to not really ‘getting’ these loose, wet meat sandwiches; when my son, Harry, went through a Subway meatball and sauce phase, I threatened to disown him. My lack of enthusiasm comes partly from a disastrous experience with a Bunny Chow (Durban chicken curry in a hollowed out loaf of bread).' (Ben Watson)
Ingredients:
500g minced pork ½ large green pepper, diced ½ large onion, diced 100ml tomato ketchup 100ml bottled barbecue sauce 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tsp chilli powder ½ tsp mustard powder Tabasco sauce, to taste 4 burger buns, to serve salted crisps & gherkins, to serve
Method:
Brown the mince in a large frying pan and drain off any excess fat. Add all of the other ingredients up to and including the mustard, then cover and simmer over a low heat for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavours to mix. Add Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper to taste, then spoon on to the buns. Apparently you should serve with salted crisps and a dill pickle but either way, tuck in your bib.
