Cucumber, strawberry and basil salad
Introduction:
Strawberries are often best eaten at room temperature but here everything is better served chilled. We grow the mini cucumbers in our polytunnels; their flavour is second to none. 
Ingredients:
2 mini cucumbers 300g strawberries splash of cider vinegar a pinch of 2 of brown sugar/splash of elderflower cordial (optional) 4 mint leaves small handful of basil
Method:
Wash the cucumbers well, cut in half lengthways and remove the soft, seeded core with the tip of a teaspoon. Slice into 1cm wide angled slices. Remove the tops from the strawberries and slice into halves or generous slices. Dress with a splash of cider vinegar and a pinch or two of sugar, or a dash of elderflower cordial instead. Finely shred and add the mint. Tear in the basil. Mix and serve straightaway.
