Easy ideas for radicchio
Introduction:
Radicchio is a slightly bitter, chicory-family leaf, which should either be balanced out in with sweeter and milder tastes in salads, or cooked, so that it mellows. 
Ingredients:
radicchio
Method:
Cut radicchio in half and the half again into sixths. Each wedge can be wilted either on a griddle plate or in a little olive oil in a pan, until it has turned a slightly brown colour. The cooked radicchio also works well in a dauphinoise potato gratin type affair, layered up with potatoes and some streaky bacon.
