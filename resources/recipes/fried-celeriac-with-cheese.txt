Fried celeriac with cheese
Introduction:
The celeriac season lasts from October to March and this quick recipe fully exploits its comforting, aniseed taste. This is fabulous with just about any meat or fish â€“ or could be enjoyed on its own as a starter. Substitute another hard cheese for Parmesan to make it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
500g celeriac 2 garlic cloves 3 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 50g Parmesan cheese
Method:
Peel the celeriac (you'll need a knife) and cut into matchsticks. Crush the garlic and fry in the oil with the celeriac for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the finely chopped parsley and season. Transfer to a shallow dish. Grate the cheese and sprinkle on top of the celeriac mixture. Place under a hot grill until the cheese is melted and brown.
