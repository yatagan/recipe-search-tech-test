Easy ideas for cabbage
Introduction:
Slow-cooking is a fail-safe way of cooking cabbage, but don't forget it has a lovely fresh crunch and retains more nutrients when kept raw or very briefly cooked. 
Ingredients:
Cabbage
Method:
A dish from Modena, the home of balsamic vinegar: mix very finely shredded Savoy cabbage with slivers of Parmesan and a drizzle of good aged balsamic vinegar. Serve with slices of prosciutto. Melt some butter in a pan, sprinkle in some caraway seeds and cook for a couple of minutes. Stir in finely shredded white or green cabbage, cover and cook slowly for 10 minutes or until soft. Chopped cooked bacon can be stirred in to keep meat eaters happy.
