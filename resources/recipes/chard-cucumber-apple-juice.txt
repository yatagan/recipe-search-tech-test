Chard, cucumber & apple juice
Introduction:
To extract as much juice as possible from leafy veg, roll them together tightly before putting them through the machine. Chard has a distinct grassy, slightly bitter note, but should be balanced out by the sweet apple and mild cucumber. A squeeze or two of lemon can combat anything that tastes too worthy. This should yield about 3-400ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier, higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge. 
Ingredients:
100g chard 1 celery stalks 3 apples, cores & stalks removed Â½ cucumber squeeze of lemon, to taste
Method:
Put everything through the juicer apart from the lemon. Adjust with lemon to your taste.
