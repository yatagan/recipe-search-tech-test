Roasted tomatoes
Introduction:
A super-versatile way with cherry tomatoes. Eat as a side to grilled chicken or halloumi and asparagus. Stir into spelt or pearl barley with other roasted Mediterranean veg and a spoonful of pesto. Combine with white beans, slow-cooked onions and torn basil. Pep up your pasta with them and a generous grating of Parmesan... Before roasting you could trickle over a little balsamic vinegar for a more sweet-sour finish. 
Ingredients:
3-4 cherry tomatoes per person herbs eg. marjoram, oregano or thyme (optional) olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Slice the tomatoes in half, cross-ways. Place on a non-stick baking tray or one lined with baking parchment. Sprinkle the herbs across the top, if using. Drizzle with a little good olive oil and season. Roast for about 45 minutes, until sticky and starting to caramelise.
