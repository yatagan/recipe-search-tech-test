Pot roasted rolled rib of beef (leg of mutton cut)
Introduction:
Rolled rib of beef (or leg of mutton cut) is a well-flavoured, simple to prepare joint that's good for slow roasting. The time it takes to cook to juicy tenderness is ideal for a Sunday when you want to head out for a walk to work up an appetite, and return to a delicious aroma. Serve with mash and roasted root veg. 
Ingredients:
1.5kg rolled rib of beef or leg of mutton cut 2 tbsp olive oil 2 bay leaves, sprig of rosemary, sprig of thyme - all tied together in a bundle 400g shallots 2 carrots, peeled & diced 2 sticks celery, diced 500ml red wine 2 tbsp tomato purée 15g butter 1 tbsp plain flour salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Pat dry the beef joint, rub with olive oil all over and brown in a hot frying pan on all sides. Transfer the joint to a deepish roasting dish - choose something that isn’t too large (or the roasting liquid will be too shallow around the joint), but capacious enough to fit all the stock vegetables around the meat too. Sit the herbs, whole shallots and vegetables around the joint and pour in the wine. Season liberally and slowly bring the liquid to simmering point then stir in the tomato purée. Cover with foil and tuck tightly around the edges before transferring to the oven for 3 ½ hours. Soften the butter and press it into a paste with the flour. Remove the beef from the roasting dish and stand in a warm place for 10 minutes before carving. Remove the herbs from the sauce and discard. Check seasoning of the sauce and adjust if necessary. Place the sauce over low heat, whisk in the butter/flour paste to enrich and thicken it then serve over thick slices of beef.
