Pork steak with apple sauce and smoked Cheddar
Introduction:
This is a quick and delicious full-flavoured main course – tender pork, creamy, smoky cheese and sweet apple sauce. Either make your own apple sauce or use shop bought. This goes well with braised cabbage and mashed potato. 
Ingredients:
1 pork steak (for small children use ½ a steak each) black pepper 1 tbsp apple sauce from a jar (or make your own, see our website) 1 slice smoked Cheddar cheese
Method:
Heat the grill to medium. Place the pork steak on a foiled grill tray, brushed with a little oil. Fold the foil over a little around the edge, to make a small lip. Grill the pork steak gently on either side until cooked through, about 12-15 minutes. Once cooked through, remove from the grill and turn up the heat. Grind a little black pepper on each steak. Spoon a tablespoon of apple sauce on top of each, spread it out a little and top with a slice of cheese. Place back under the grill and cook until the cheese is melted, bubbling and slightly browned. Serve with any juices caught in the foil.
