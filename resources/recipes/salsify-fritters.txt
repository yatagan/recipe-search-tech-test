salsify fritters
Introduction:
These addictive little fritters are a lovely alternative to bubble and squeak or hash browns for a proper brunch. They go well with all the usual brunch pillars – crisp bacon, a fried or poached egg, black pudding or sausages. Alternatively, eat them as a light lunch dish with a salad or greens. 
Ingredients:
400g salsify 1 garlic clove, finely chopped leaves from a small bunch of thyme, finely chopped 2 tbsp plain flour 2 large eggs, lightly beaten generous knob of butter salt & black pepper
Method:
Peel and coarsely grate the salsify (a food processor saves effort). In a large bowl, mix the salsify with the garlic, thyme and some salt and pepper. Add the flour and mix well, then pour in the beaten eggs and mix again. Warm a generous knob of butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Form the mixture into fritters about the size of the palm of your hand and no more than 0.5cm thick so they cook right through. Put the fritters into the frying pan and turn the heat down low. Flip a couple of times during cooking and, as they absorb the butter, add a little more. Cook slowly for 10–15 minutes, until deep golden brown on both sides. Serve hot.
