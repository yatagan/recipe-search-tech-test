Spinach and chard with raisins and toasted pine nuts

This easy and nutritious vegan side dish could also be made of both chard and spinach together for more complexity of flavour. The earthy tones of these sturdy green vegetables go especially well with lamb.

Cook spinach or chard leaves in boiling water for 1 minute, then drain, refresh in cold water and drain again. Squeeze out all the liquid. Fry some sliced garlic in olive oil until soft, add the spinach or chard and toss with the raisins and toasted pine nuts. Season and serve.
