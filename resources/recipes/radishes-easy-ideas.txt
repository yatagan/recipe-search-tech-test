Ingredients:
Radishes
Method:
You can cook radishes, which softens and sweetens the taste, so if you’re not a great fan of them raw, try simmering them in a little stock for just a few mins until tender. Toss in a little melted butter and throw in some chopped fresh herbs (eg. mint or parsley) and serve as a side dish for meat or fish. If we send them out bunched, with their leaves, you can eat them too. Cut the leaves off when they arrive, to stop moisture leaching from the radish into the leaves. Radishes can soften quite quickly after they’re picked. To refresh their crisp texture, pop in a bowl of iced water for a few mins and they’ll come back to life. salata baladi serves 4, prep 10 minutes, cook 0 minutes This simple, traditional Lebanese dish is usually made with their short cucumbers.
