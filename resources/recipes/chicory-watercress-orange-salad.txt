Chicory, watercress and orange salad
Introduction:
Chicory's mild bitterness pairs very well with the sweet juiciness of oranges. This punchy summer salad could be a starter or side, or expanded into a light main with the addition of flakes of smoked mackerel or slices of duck, chunks of earthy roast beetroot or carrot, or crumbled feta. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp sherry or red wine vinegar pinch sugar 5 tbsp olive oil or 3 tbsp walnut oil with 2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 bunches watercress 3 heads chicory, sliced into rounds 2 oranges, peeled & cut into chunks 40g walnut pieces salt & pepper
Method:
Whisk the vinegar with the sugar and seasoning, gradually whisking in the oil. Taste and adjust the seasonings and pour into a salad bowl. Tear the watercress into small pieces. Place in the bowl. Scatter the chicory, orange and walnuts over the top. Toss at the table.
