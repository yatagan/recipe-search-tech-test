Gingerbread with rhubarb and orange fool
Introduction:
This sumptuous dessert recipe teams rhubarb with two of its classic flavour combinations, orange and ginger. The gingerbread keeps well in an airtight container for a few days if you have any leftover, which may be unlikely. 
Ingredients:
for the gingerbread: 3 tbsp black treacle 150ml milk 175g unsalted butter, diced 175g dark muscovado sugar 2 eggs, lightly beaten 325g plain flour, sifted 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 3 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp grated nutmeg for the fool: 500g rhubarb, cut into 3-4cm lengths 150g caster sugar zest & juice of 2 oranges 250ml double cream
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3. Grease and line a 30cm x 20cm brownie (baking) tray, one which holds 1.2 litres (2 pints) of liquid. First, make the gingerbread:Put the treacle, milk, butter and sugar in a saucepan and gently heat until the butter and sugar has melted. Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly, for about 5 minutes, then stir in the beaten eggs. Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg in a large bowl. Tip in the egg and sugar mixture and gently stir until all the ingredients are combined. Pour into the baking tin and bake for about 45 minutes, until a cocktail stick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Remove from the oven, leave to cool in the tin for 10-15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. To make the fool, put the rhubarb, sugar, orange juice and zest in a large pan. Gently heat for about 10-15 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender (test by inserting a sharp knife). Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Whisk the cream in a large bowl (don’t over-whisk, just do enough so that it is forming soft peaks). Add the rhubarb mixture and gently fold into the cream. Serve the gingerbread cut into squares with a dollop of fool on the side.
