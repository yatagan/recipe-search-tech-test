Guy’s kale hash
Introduction:
This is a real treat on a cold day. You can use any cabbage or sliced Brussels sprouts in place of kale here. To make a complete supper, top with a poached egg. 
Ingredients:
300g kale, stripped from its stems (cavolo nero or curly are best for this recipe, but you can use red Russian too) 1 tbsp olive oil 300g chorizo, chopped 1 onion, chopped 500g cooked potatoes, cut into 2cm dice 2 garlic cloves, crushed salt & black pepper
Method:
Blanch the kale in a large saucepan of boiling water (1–2 minutes for curly, 2–3 minutes for cavolo nero; 30 seconds for red Russian). Drain well, refresh in cold water and drain again. Squeeze out excess water and chop roughly. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the chorizo and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until just starting to brown. Remove the chorizo with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the onion to the chorizo fat in the pan and cook gently for 10 minutes, until soft. Add the potatoes and garlic, turn up the heat to get some colour on the potatoes, and cook for 5 minutes, turning the potatoes until browned all over. Return the chorizo to the pan with the kale, reduce the heat and cook gently for a further 5 minutes, until well mixed and thoroughly heated through. Season and serve.
