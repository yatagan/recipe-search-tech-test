Piccalilli dressing
Introduction:
This can be used as a standard dressing for salad leaf or to dress some lightly blanched veg with a bite, think cauliflower, green beans or purple sprouting broccoli. Whatever way you use it spoon it over at the end rather than mixing as it serves to best display the vibrant colour.
Ingredients:
1 tsp turmeric 1 tbsp cider vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard (or ½ tsp hot English mustard) ¼ tsp ground ginger ¼ tsp brown sugar 1 egg yolk ½ garlic clove, crushed 3 tbsp sunflower oil 1 tbsp olive oil
Method:
For the dressing put all the ingredients in a clean jam jar, screw the lid on tightly and shake like fury for 30 seconds.
