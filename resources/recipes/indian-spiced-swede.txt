Indian spiced swede
Introduction:
This quick, vegan dish of swede and kale makes a lovely simple supper. The cool creaminess of the coconut milk is a good balance to the heat of the Indian spices. If you don't have kale use chard, spinach or spring or winter greens instead. Serve with fluffy, fragrant rice to soak up the juices. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp sunflower oil 3 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp black mustard seeds Â¼ tsp turmeric 1 red onion, finely sliced 3-4cm piece ginger, peeled & grated 2 garlic cloves 2 chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 600g swede, cut into small dice 400ml tinned coconut milk 200g cavolo nero, leaves stripped from stalks & shredded juice of 1 lime, more to taste 4 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the cumin and mustard seeds. Fry for about 1 minute, until the seeds pop. Add the turmeric, onion, ginger, garlic, chilli and swede. Fry for a couple of minutes. Add the coconut milk and 100ml water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer gently until tender, about 10-12 minutes. Add the cavolo nero and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the greens have wilted. Season, then stir in the lime juice and coriander to serve.
