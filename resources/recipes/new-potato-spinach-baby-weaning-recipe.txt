New potato and spinach baby weaning recipe
Introduction:
This baby weaning recipe was provided by one of our customers who thought it up for her 6 month old. She reports that this dish went down a treat (although there was green goo everywhere because of her daughter's efforts to gobble it up quickly!). This makes a large amount, some of which can be frozen in small pots or ice cube trays.
Ingredients:
1 small-medium onion, chopped 4 small-medium new potatoes, cubed 4 large handfuls of spinach, de-stalked & chopped 40g mild Cheddar cheese
Method:
Place the onion and potatoes in a pan cover with water and boil until tender. Add the spinach and continue to cook until mushy. Most of the liquid should have evaporated off but if not, drain and reserve the cooking water. Put the cooked veggies and cheese in a jug or bowl and blend using a hand blender or a liquidiser if you have one. Add the reserved cooking liquid until you are happy with the consistency.
