Pressed brisket
Introduction:
If sandwiches and salads are the order of the day, try making your own corned beef. A soy based stock gives it a pacific rim twist. Unfortunately good soy sauce is expensive so cooking in a boiling or roasting bag, in a pan of water, keeps the beef immersed in a relatively small amount. 
Ingredients:
300ml soy sauce 200ml dry cider 50ml cider vinegar 1 heaped tbsp brown sugar 4 star anise good thumb ginger root 2 garlic cloves 1 small red chilli 600g brisket
Method:
Put everything apart from the beef in a pan and simmer for 30 minutes. Allow to cool and pour into a bag. Add the beef, carefully squeeze out the air and seal. Place in a large pan of water, bring to the boil and simmer for about 2Â½ hours. Remove from the pan, prick or untie the bag and drain out most of the juice (you can freeze it and use it for gravy etc. another time). Press the beef (still in its bag) into a suitably sized bread tin or Tupperware container, and weigh down with a bag of sugar or similar. Cool in the fridge overnight. Slice as thinly as you can for sandwiches or salads of crunchy julienned vegetables (cucumbers, onions, beans, peppers etc).
