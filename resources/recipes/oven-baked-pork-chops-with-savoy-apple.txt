Oven baked pork chops with Savoy and apple
Introduction:
This chuck-it-all-in-one-tray pork and cabbage recipe is very good for a busy evening. If you have bone-in pork chops with a lot of fatty skin on, fry the chops on their fatty edge to crisp up before placing in the baking tray. Eat with boiled or mashed potatoes. 
Ingredients:
4 pork chops 4 apples, cored & cut into quarters ½ large Savoy cabbage, cut into 4 wedges, core left in 12 sage leaves, roughly chopped olive oil butter salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Mix the pork chops, apple, cabbage and sage leaves together in a roasting tray. Drizzle over a little olive oil and dot the cabbage with a little butter. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, turning everything once, until the pork is cooked through and the cabbage is just tender.
