courgettes - easy ideas
Introduction:
Our homegrown courgettes start in July. They are really versatile. You can eat them raw, thinly sliced or grated; try making long courgette strips with a veg peeler for salads or pasta. Fry quickly with chilli and mint or lemon and basil. Chop into chunks and roast. Or make courgette fritters with a tangy salsa (there are several recipes on our website).
