Spring greens with wet and wild garlic
Introduction:
Fresh spring greens and garlic, bursting with vitality and flavour, make a nutritious and delicious side. If you're lucky enough to have wild garlic growing near you (most likely in shady places near water), pick yourself a generous handful for this recipe â€“ or wait for it to come in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter 1 tbsp olive oil 2 wet garlic bulbs, chopped, or 1 clove of garlic, sliced 350g-500g spring greens bunch wild garlic leaves 1 tbsp Parmesan, freshly grated salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter with the oil in a large saucepan. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes without browning. Slice the spring green heads crossways into strips of about 1cm. Wash well and add to the garlic, turning the heat up and stirring vigorously for about 4-5 minutes until wilted. At this point add the shredded wild garlic leaves, stir in with the greens and cook for 1 minute. Finish by stirring in freshly grated Parmesan and season.
