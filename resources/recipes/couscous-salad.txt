Couscous salad
Introduction:
This clean salad showcases the tastes and textures of summer. Once the tomatoes are roasted, it's almost instant to make. This is lovely eaten alongside fish, chicken or a kebab. To make it a standalone meal, crumble a little feta on top. 
Ingredients:
6 tomatoes 4 tbsp couscous 1 tsp olive oil 125ml boiling water 2 tbsp olive oil Â½ cucumber, cut into 1cm cubes 1 tbsp pine nuts, toasted chives or parsley or coriander, finely chopped 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the tomatoes in half and place skin side down in a shallow baking tray or pan. Season and drizzle around with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Cook slowly in a low oven for 1-2 hours until semi-dried, this will concentrate the flavour. Put the couscous in a bowl with the oil and boiling water, cover tightly and allow to soak for 5 minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork and mix in the rest of the ingredients.
