Smoked chicken breast
Introduction:
A handful of hardwood shavings and any Weber style barbecue with a lid is all you need. It really only needs 30 minutes in the smoke then it can be finished off in the oven or, even better, in a steamer. 
Ingredients:
2 chicken fillets 1 tsp salt olive oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 130Â°C/Gas 1. Remove the skin from the chicken. Sprinkle a heaped teaspoon of salt over all sides of two chicken fillets. Leave for at least 2 hours. Rinse off, pat dry with kitchen paper and brush with olive oil. Smoke over smoldering hardwood shavings for 30-60 minutes, depending on density of smoke (less smoke means it will need longer). Transfer the oven until fully cooked. A meat thermometer is best but if not, insert a skewer into the thickest part of the breast - if the juices run clear then it is cooked.
