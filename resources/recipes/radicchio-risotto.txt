Radicchio risotto
Introduction:
Slightly bitter radicchio makes a nice contrast to the starchiness of the rice and the rich, reduced stock. For a vegetarian version leave out the sausage and add a handful of saut√©ed mushooms, or some peas or chopped asparagus. This goes down very well with a bottle of white wine. 
Ingredients:
1 large head radicchio 300g sliced Italian sausage 6 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 small onion, finely sliced 400g rice 2 litres chicken or vegetable stock 40g butter 60g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Clean and finely chop the radicchio leaves and dice the stems. Break the sausage meat into chunks. Put the sausage and radicchio in a large pan with the oil, garlic and onion and brown for a few minutes. Add the rice and mix well to coat each grain with the oil. Add the boiling stock, ladle by ladle, stirring continuously. Wait until each ladleful is absorbed before you add the next. After 15-20 minutes the rice should be cooked. Remove from the heat, adjust the seasoning and add a little more stock if required. Add the butter in chunks, along with the Parmesan, and mix well before serving.
