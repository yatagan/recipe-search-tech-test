Crushed carrot and cumin salad with yoghurt and tahini dressing
Introduction:
This vegetarian dish is a lovely way of enjoying the caramel sweetness of slow roasted carrots. The dressing is clean and fresh – a good counterbalance to the sweetness. Try this as part of a mezze spread with baba ganoush and hummus and toasted pittas for dipping. 
Ingredients:
750g bunch carrots 4 tbsp olive oil 2 tsp cumin seeds, lightly toasted & ground 100ml yoghurt 20 ml tahini 1 lemon handful each of fresh parsley, chives & mint, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Scrub and trim the carrots, then cut them in half lengthways. Put them in a roasting tin and toss with the olive oil. Roast for about 50 minutes until they are tender, slightly browned and have a caramelised appearance. Mash the roasted carrots roughly with a fork, a masher or your hands and mix with the ground cumin. For the dressing, mix the yoghurt, tahini, a dash of lemon juice and the herbs together. Season to taste. Spread the mashed carrots on a plate and sprinkle with the yoghurt and tahini dressing.
