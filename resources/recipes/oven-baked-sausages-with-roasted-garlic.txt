Introduction:
This variation on classic bangers and mash makes a good, hassle-free family dinner. It goes well with mustard and seasonal greens such as purple sprouting broccoli, spring greens, kale or chard. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 8-12 sausages 6 large garlic cloves, left in their skins 500g parsnips, peeled & diced 600g potatoes, peeled & diced 60ml milk 30g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan, then add the sausages and fry until browned all over. Put the garlic cloves in a baking dish and toss in the oil to coat, then bake for 10 minutes. Add the sausages and toss together. Bake for another 20-25 minutes, until the sausages are cooked through. Meanwhile cook the parsnips and potatoes in a large pan of boiling water until tender, then drain. Remove the sausages and garlic from the oven, then heat the milk and butter in a small pan. Squeeze the garlic from their skins into the warm milk and stir to combine. Add to the potato and parsnips and mash together, then season to taste. Serve with the baked sausages and seasonal greens.
