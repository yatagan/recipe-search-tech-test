Chicken, spinach & lemon curry
Introduction:
A tasty curry with no creamy sauce. It freezes well too. We like a good chilli and citrus hit - add both to taste. This can also be made with diced chicken leg, but simmer it for a little longer, 20-30 minutes. Serve with rice or naan and a dollop of yoghurt and mango or other Indian chutney.
Ingredients:
Oil for frying 300g diced chicken breast, or 1 large chicken breast, diced, if youâ€™re stretching a whole chicken over several meals 1 onion, peeled & finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, peeled & finely chopped 3-4cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 1 chilli, finely chopped, with or without seeds for more heat 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp cardamom pods, bashed slightly 2 lemons 300-400ml hot chicken or veg stock 200g spinach Small bunch coriander, leaves chopped Salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pan. Season the chicken and fry to lightly brown the meat. Transfer it to a plate. Add the onion to the same pan with a splash more oil. Gently fry for 10 mins, stirring often. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli and stir for 1 min. Stir in the cumin, coriander, turmeric and cardamom. Return the chicken to the pan. Add the juice from 1 lemon and enough stock to cover the meat. Simmer for approx 10-15 mins, until the chicken is cooked. Stir in the spinach leaves until wilted (you may need to add a little more stock) and coriander leaves. Add more lemon juice and season to taste.
