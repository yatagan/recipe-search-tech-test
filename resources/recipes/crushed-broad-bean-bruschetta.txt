Crushed broad bean bruschetta
Introduction:
A delectable vegetarian springtime starter. If you make this early in the broad bean season, while theyâ€™re still small and soft, you can skip the double podding that broad beans usually call for. Two lovely additions: spread your toasted bread with a little fresh ricotta before piling on the beans, or top the crushed beans with crispily fried pancetta or bacon lardons. 
Ingredients:
500g broad beans (weight in their pods), podded 1 lemon olive oil 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated, & more to serve small bunch mint leaves, finely chopped pinch dried chilli flakes thin slices of sourdough or ciabatta 1 garlic clove salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the beans in salted water for 3-5 minutes until tender, then mash roughly with a fork. Finely zest the lemon, then squeeze the juice of one half into the beans. Stir in 4 tablespoons of olive oil, the lemon zest, Parmesan, mint and chilli. Season with salt and pepper to taste (you may want a little more lemon juice too). Toast, grill or griddle the bread, then rub with a cut clove of garlic. Drizzle with some olive oil, then pile on the broad bean mixture and grate over a little more cheese to serve.
