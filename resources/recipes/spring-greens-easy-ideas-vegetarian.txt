Easy ideas for spring greens - meat free
Introduction:
These sweet tasting loose leaved cabbages are very versatile. You can use in recipes that call for cabbage. To prep them trim off any tough base stalks. Wash the leaves and leave to drain. Cut out any larger tougher ribs, although if they are particularly tender or small leaves you can use the ribs too. Shred the leaves. 
Ingredients:
Spring greens
Method:
To cook simply, boil or steam for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Add a knob of butter and some salt and pepper. Heat a little oil or butter, add the greens and stir until wilted. Season to taste, adding a little lemon juice if you like. If you have any wild garlic to hand, add some shredded leaves. Stir fry in groundnut/sunflower oil, with chopped garlic and a good splash of soy sauce. Try adding finely sliced chilli and grated ginger. Sprinkle with toasted chopped peanuts/cashews or lightly toasted coconut if you like. Add to curries, stews and soups, or wilt into pasta and risotto.
