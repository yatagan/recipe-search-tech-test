Romanesco tabbouleh with almonds and pistachios
Introduction:
Visually striking, light and easy to make, this salad does well for anything from a healthy packed lunch to a celebratory mezze spread. If possible, let it rest for an hour or so before eating so that the flavours come together fully. Bulghur can be substituted for quinoa for a gluten-free version. 
Ingredients:
1 large Romanesco 200g bulghur wheat grated zest & juice of 1 lemon olive oil 100g flaked almonds 100g shelled pistachios large handful fresh parsley, chopped large handful fresh mint, chopped handful pomegranate seeds (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Cut the florets from the Romanesco, chopping them into roughly equal sized pieces, and not too large, or they will burn before they cook. Toss in oil to coat. Season. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until crisp and brown at the edges. Put the bulghur in a heatproof bowl. Pour over at least twice the volume of boiled water. Leave to stand. Dry fry the almonds and pistachios in batches to toast. Roughly chop. Check the bulghur is cooked through, still with some bite. Drain and press it with a wooden spoon to get rid of any excess liquid. Toss with the Romanesco, nuts, herbs, lemon zest. Season, add lemon juice and oil to taste. Scatter with pomegranate seeds, if using.
