Sambal cauli
Introduction:
A spicy side of cauliflower. This hot sambal sauce (a chilli-based condiment from South India) can be used with any veg – especially French beans –, or with grilled fish or chicken. You can find sambal oelek (or ulek) and blachan in specialist Asian food stores or buy them online. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 tsp sambal oelek (a simple chilli paste, sometimes called ulek) ½ tsp blachan (shrimp paste) ½ tsp salt 1 cauliflower, broken into florets 3 tbsp hot water
Method:
Cook the onion and garlic in sunflower oil over a low heat in a heavy-based pan for about 10 minutes. Add the sambal oelek and blachan and cook for a few more minutes. Stir in the cauliflower florets and salt and cook for a few more minutes before adding 3 tablespoons of hot water. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until tender.
