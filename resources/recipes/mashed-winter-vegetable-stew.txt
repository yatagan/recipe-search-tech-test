Mashed winter vegetable stew
Introduction:
This simple vegetarian dish is a good way of using up whatever veg you have â€“ the exact quantities aren't at all important. Serve with a heap of cous cous and dress with parsley, a squeeze of lemon and a little Parmesan (or vegetarian equivalent). 
Ingredients:
2-3 tsp veg bouillon powder 1 bay leaf 400g potatoes, cubed 400g carrots, peeled & diced sprig rosemary or thyme 2 garlic cloves, chopped 2-3 leeks, sliced 500g sprouts or kale, shredded pinch nutmeg, grated flat leaf parsley, chopped Parmesan, grated olive oil squeeze lemon juice salt & pepper
Method:
Put about an inch of water in the bottom of a large saucepan. Bring to the boil. Add the stock powder and the bay leaf, then the potato, carrot, thyme or rosemary and garlic. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are nearly tender, then add the leeks and the sprouts or kale. Cover again and continue cooking until all the vegetables are fairly soft. At this point the stew should have a slightly soupy consistency - add a little more water if necessary. Using a potato masher, roughly mash the vegetables. Season to taste and add the nutmeg and the parsley. Put the stew on plates or in bowls and dress each one with plenty of good oil, some grated Parmesan and a squeeze of lemon juice if you like.
