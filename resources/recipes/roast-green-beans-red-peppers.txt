roast green beans and red peppers
Introduction:
Green beans are good in salads and you may find some in your salad box this week. Toss cooked beans in with a mixed salad or use in a niçoise style salad. This roasted bean recipe can be served warm as a side vegetable or at room temperature as a salad. A little torn basil makes a good addition.
Ingredients:
2 red peppers 250g green beans, topped & tailed 3 tsp olive oil a few drops balsamic or red wine vinegar (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas Mark 6 and place the whole red peppers on a tray on the top shelf. Spread the beans out on another baking tray and toss with 1 teaspoon of olive oil. After 20 minutes check the pepper – the skin should be wrinkling and puffing up a little and it should be developing some dark areas. Turn to expose the other side and put in the beans below the peppers. Cook for a further 20 minutes, checking both beans and peppers after 10 minutes and turning if necessary. The beans are ready when they are wrinkled, tender and beginning to brown and the pepper should have puffed up with dark spots on the skin. Take out the beans and place the cooked pepper in a covered saucepan for 10 minutes to steam and cool slightly. When the pepper is cool enough to handle, pull off the skin, tear it open and remove core and seeds. Slice the pepper into thin strips and mix with the beans. Add 2 more teaspoons of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste and a few drops of vinegar if you like. If you want to serve this as a hot vegetable, reheat by turning the beans and peppers in a frying pan for a few minutes before serving.
