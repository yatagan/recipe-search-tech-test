Potato rosti
Introduction:
This is a quick and simple dish which used to be eaten for breakfast by Swiss farmers. For a speedy vegetarian meal, eat with spinach and a fried egg. Try adding to the rosti â€“ grated apple or cheese, cooked onion or bacon, fresh herbs. This can be made with both floury and waxy potatoes: the first gets a more mash-like consistency while and second retains the individual potato strands. 
Ingredients:
4 potatoes 1 onion salt & pepper oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower
Method:
Peel and grate potatoes, squeezing out the moisture. Grate the onion and add to the potato, seasoning well. Heat a generous layer of oil in a heavy frying pan over a medium heat. Press dollops of potato mix into the pan, flattening into rough patties. Fry gently for about 10 minutes on each side until crisp and golden.
