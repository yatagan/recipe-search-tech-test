Gratin of courgettes with potatoes and tomatoes
Introduction:
This is quick to get in the oven. It goes well with red meat, but is substantial and tasty enough to be a light vegetarian meal in its own right, perhaps with bread and salad. Good variations if you're eating it as a main are to add in slices of mozzarella or ham. 
Ingredients:
225g tomatoes 225g courgettes 225g waxy potatoes, e.g. Charlotte, Jersey Royals or Maris Peer 1 medium-sized red onion ½ tbsp dried oregano 3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the tomatoes and courgettes into dices about 5mm thick, then sprinkle them lightly with salt and leave for 30 minutes. Wipe dry. Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly. Halve the onion lengthways and slice each half thinly. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Arrange the vegetables in a single closely overlapping layer like tiles on a roof, alternating potato, tomatoes, courgettes and onion in an oiled heatproof dish. Season lightly with salt but add plenty of pepper. Sprinkle over the oregano. Drizzle over the olive oil. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. As the gratin cooks, baste 2 or 3 times with its juices, trying not to disturb the arrangement too much. If the gratin threatens to burn cover with foil towards the end of the cooking time. Serve hot.
