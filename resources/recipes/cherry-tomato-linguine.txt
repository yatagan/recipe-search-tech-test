Cherry tomato linguine
Introduction:
This vegetarian pasta sauce has a simple, vibrant taste. It can be made in less than 15 minutes, so it's ideal if you don't feel like hanging around in the kitchen. To soften the garlic flavour, fry it briefly before adding to the pasta. Linguine goes well with this, but any other long pasta would do. 
Ingredients:
20 cherry tomatoes 2 garlic cloves, crushed 8 basil leaves 300g linguine splash red wine vinegar few capers, anchovies & fried breadcrumbs (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. Have the cherry tomatoes and toss with the garlic, shredded basil and cooked linguine. Season, then finish with olive oil and a little red wine vinegar. Capers and anchovies can be added too, as well as crisp fried breadcrumbs.
