Middle Eastern style runner beans
Introduction:
At once light and comforting, this dish of slow-cooked runner beans in a rich, spiced tomato sauce makes a delicious and healthy vegetarian main. Serve it with brown rice, or with couscous flavoured with lemon juice and zest, chopped black olives and finely chopped parsley and mint. If you have a glut of runner beans to contend with, this freezes well. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 onions, sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp cumin seeds Â¼ tsp paprika 500g runner beans, topped, tailed & trimmed each side with a veg peeler, cut into 1cm slices on the diagonal 450g ripe tomatoes, diced juice of 1 lemon 6 tbsp veg stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion on a very low heat for 10-12 minutes until soft. Add the garlic, cumin and paprika. Turn the heat up slightly and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes, lemon juice and stock. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer gently for about 40-45 minutes, until the beans are very soft.
