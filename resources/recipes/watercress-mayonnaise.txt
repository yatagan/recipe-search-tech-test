Watercress mayonnaise
Introduction:
This peppery watercress mayonnaise is especially good with poached salmon, trout or chicken and some buttery new potatoes. If you're vegetarian, try it with a celery and green leaf salad topped with toasted walnuts. If you're feeling ambitious, this is even more satisfying with homemade mayonnaise. 
Ingredients:
bunch watercress, washed small handful fresh parsley, chopped 150ml mayonnaise 2 tbsp yoghurt 1 tsp Dijon or other French mustard
Method:
Blend all the ingredients in a food processor or blender until smooth.
