Grilled spring onions and asparagus with lime and coarse sea salt
Introduction:
Sometimes the best meals are the least complicated. For this elegant, unfussy recipe the asparagus should be fairly thin â€“ no more than 1 cm in diameter. This is good both warm and at room temperature. If you aren't keen on the lime and salt combination, another good dressing is vinaigrette. This could could be turned into a light lunch with hard-boiled eggs and garlic-rubbed bruschetta. 
Ingredients:
4 fat spring onions or very thin baby leeks, trimmed 4 asparagus spears, trimmed olive or sunflower oil wedges of lime coarse sea salt
Method:
Brush the spring onions and asparagus with the oil and grill, turning until patched with brown and tender. Serve immediately with lime and sea salt.
