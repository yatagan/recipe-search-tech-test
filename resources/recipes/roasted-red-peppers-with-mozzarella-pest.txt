Roasted red peppers with mozzarella and pesto
Introduction:
Easy to construct, these filled, baked red peppers have a marvellous, vibrant flavour. Eat as a starter or as a light meal with bread to sop up the oil and juices. The flavour's better if you use long, tapering Ramiro peppers, but ordinary bell peppers are fine as well. 
Ingredients:
1 pepper 4 cherry tomatoes, halved 1 small garlic clove, chopped 4 anchovy fillets, chopped a few capers 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp pesto, or some basil leaves a few slices of mozzarella
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 1. Slice the pepper in half lengthways and remove the ribs and seeds. Place cut side up on a baking sheet and distribute the cherry tomatoes, garlic, anchovies and capers between the halves, then drizzle over the olive oil. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the edges are just beginning to colour. Drizzle over the pesto if using (you may want to thin it with a little olive oil) then lay the slices of cheese over the peppers, and return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes. If using basil leaves, tear them up and scatter over the peppers just before serving.
