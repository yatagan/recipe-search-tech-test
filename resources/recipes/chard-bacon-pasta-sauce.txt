Chard and bacon pasta sauce
Introduction:
This creamy pasta sauce combines the salty, rich flavour of bacon with the green goodness of chard. The same recipes works well with spring or winter greens and with spinach, which'll need less cooking time. Add a pinch of chilli if you want a bit more of a kick.
Ingredients:
500g pasta – penne or farfalle work well 1 bag chard 150g bacon 2 garlic cloves, chopped 150g crème fraîche or mascarpone Parmesan, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Heat a large pan of water for the pasta and cook according to the packet instructions. Meanwhile, wash the chard well and separate the leaves from the stalks. Cut the stalks into lengths of about ½-1cm. Chop the bacon into lardons and fry gently until the fat begins to run out. Add the chard stalks and garlic. Stew in the bacon fat for a few minutes – you may need to add some butter depending on your bacon. When the stalks are nearly tender, add the chard leaves (roughly chopped), cover and cook until wilted. Boil off any liquid and add the crème fraîche or mascarpone. Wait for it to melt and bubble, until you have the consistency you want. Season well, mix with the pasta and serve with plenty of grated Parmesan.
