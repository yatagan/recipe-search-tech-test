Sautéed artichokes, potatoes and carrot
Introduction:
Apart from the slight fiddle of preparing the artichokes, this is a very easy vegetarian side. It goes well with lamb chops, grilled portobello mushrooms or chicken. There's no need to be exact about proportions – this recipe's all about using up whatever new season veg you have in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
2 large globe artichokes lemon juice 3 tbsp olive oil 350g waxy salad potatoes, peeled & diced into 1cm cubes 225g medium carrot, sliced about 1cm thick ½ tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped ½ tbsp fresh fennel or dill, chopped ½ tbsp fresh chives, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Snap the stems off the artichokes. Using a sharp knife, cut the leaves and scrape off the choke. Turn in lemon juice as you work to prevent browning. Dice the naked bases into 1cm cubes. Toss in lemon juice and pat dry. Heat the olive oil in a wide, heavy frying-pan. Add the potatoes, artichokes and carrots and sauté gently for about 15 minutes, turning frequently, until tender and browned. Drain briefly on kitchen paper, then toss with herbs, salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
