Potato, celeriac and truffle oil soup
Introduction:
Truffle oil can be increasingly easily found in supermarkets as well as delis. It's expensive, but you only need a tiny bit here and it keeps well. It turns this weeknight favourite into something really special. An alternative is to use olive oil. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 30g butter 4 tbsp olive oil 1 large celeriac, peeled & diced 500g potatoes, peeled & diced 1 litre chicken stock 1 bunch thyme 100ml double cream 3 tsp truffle oil
Method:
Gently fry the onion in the butter and olive oil in a large heavy bottomed pan until soft but not coloured. Add the celeriac and potatoes and sweat with the top on for a few minutes before adding the stock and thyme. Simmer for about 30 minutes. Remove the thyme, add the cream and whiz without over doing it which makes the potatoes go gloopy. Dilute if too stiff, season and add the truffle oil to taste.
