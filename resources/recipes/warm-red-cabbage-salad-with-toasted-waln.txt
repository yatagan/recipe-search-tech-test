Warm red cabbage salad with toasted walnuts and blue cheese
Introduction:
Sometimes the winter months bring too much cabbage and not enough salad. This recipe solves the problem: sweet and salty, rich in colour, texture, and flavour, this is just the thing for lightening an autumn or winter table. 
Ingredients:
75g walnut pieces 2 tbsp walnut oil 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 2½ tbsp olive oil 1 red onion, quartered & thinly sliced 1 small red cabbage, shredded 100g blue cheese, crumbled 2 crisp red apples, cored & cut into small pieces 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tsp fresh marjoram, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Toss the walnuts with the walnut oil and some black pepper. Spread them out on a baking tray and toast in the oven for 5–7 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Put the garlic, balsamic vinegar and olive oil in a frying pan and sauté over a medium heat for 3 minutes. Add the red onion and cook for 30 seconds, then add the cabbage and cook for a couple of minutes until it begins to turn from red to pink. Season. Finally add the cheese, apples, herbs and toasted walnuts. Toss well and serve.
