Guy's vinaigrette
Introduction:
A good vinaigrette, which can be put together in under five minutes, transforms plain lettuce – but it's not only for salad dressing: it can also be used to marinade meat and veg, and as a cold dressing for leeks or asparagus. Once made, it'll keep in the fridge for several weeks. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp vinegar (whichever you like most - red, white, cider, balsamic) 4 tbsp olive oil ½ sugar 1 garlic clove, crushed to a paste salt & pepper
Method:
Mix ingredients together. Add your dressing to the salad at the last minute as the vinegar can start to wilt the leaves.
