Potato and fennel gratin
Introduction:
This easily made, creamy gratin is a good weeknight supper on its own with just a green salad. Fennel and potato are also lovely accompaniments to lamb, pork or white fish. You could just use double the quantity of fennel and leave out the potatoes. Substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese to keep this vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
300ml double cream 100ml milk 2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with a pinch of salt 400g potatoes, peeled & cut into slices 2-3mm thick 400g fennel, cut into slices 2-3mm thick 1-2 tbsp Parmesan, grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Put the cream, milk and crushed garlic into a pan and bring to the boil. Season and add the potatoes and fennel, mixing well. Transfer the mixture to a gratin dish, spreading it out so that there is an even distribution of cream. Cover with foil and bake in an oven for about 50 minutes until the potatoes and fennel are tender. Remove the foil, sprinkle with the Parmesan and return to the oven for 10 minutes until browned on top.
