Chimichurri sauce for steak
Introduction:
Chimichurri is a favourite dressing for steaks in South America. Make an Argentinian version with parsley, or a Columbian version with parsley and coriander. Serve with spuds of your choice and salad. 
Ingredients:
large bunch parsley, or a mix of parsley & coriander 2 large garlic cloves (add an extra one if you love garlic!) 1 tsp dried oregano, or 1 tbsp freshly picked leaves red wine vinegar 1 lemon pinch chilli flakes olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Finely chop the parsley, and the coriander, if using. Peel and finely chop, grate or crush the garlic. Mix the herbs and garlic in a bowl, with the oregano, 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, juice from Â¼ of the lemon and some salt and pepper to season. Add a good glug or two of olive oil, enough to make a dressing. Taste and add more vinegar, lemon juice or seasoning as needed. The sauce should be quite sharp and punchy.
