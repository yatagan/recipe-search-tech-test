Kidneys with beetroot
Introduction:
This recipe is inexpensive and very nutritious. Gamey, buttery-soft lamb kidneys pair very well with the earthiness of beetroot. Wilted spinach and boiled potatoes, which both have a similar earthy profile to beets, make very good accompaniments. If you prefer kidneys to have a less strong flavour, soak them in milk for 20-30 minutes before cooking. 
Ingredients:
8 lamb kidneys 1 tbsp sunflower oil 50g butter 4 shallots, finely chopped 1 cooked beetroot, peeled & cut into 5mm batons 4 tbsp dry white wine 120ml chicken or veal stock 120ml double cream 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Trim the kidneys and cut in half horizontally. Remove core. Heat the oil and half the butter in a wide frying-pan until the butter is foaming. Add the kidneys and saut√© until just done. Set them aside and pour any excess fat off from the pan. Add the remaining butter to the same pan and cook the shallots gently until translucent. Add the beetroot and the white wine and boil until the wine is completely evaporated, leaving just moist beetroot. Quickly add the stock and boil until reduced by half. Then add the cream and boil until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Whisk in the mustard and return the kidneys to the pan. Warm through gently, seasoning with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
