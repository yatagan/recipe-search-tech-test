Roast asparagus with Parmesan
Introduction:
This is by far the easiest way to cook asparagus when you're entertaining. They shrivel a little, but their flavour is intensified. The exact cooking time depends on the thickness of the asparagus: smaller stems will take no more than 10 minutes, thicker ones up to 18 or so. Test with a skewer a couple of inches from the base of the stem to see if they are tender. 
Ingredients:
450g asparagus 6-8 tbsp olive oil coarse sea salt Parmesan, grated, to serve (optional)
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Cut the woody ends of stems off the asparagus and if you think it necessary, peel the bottom couple of inches. Generously oil a large ovenproof dish or roasting tin (big enough to take the asparagus in a tight single layer). Sprinkle coarse sea salt lightly over the base. Arrange the asparagus on top and drizzle over the remaining olive oil, erring on the generous side. Turn the asparagus with your hands to coat them nicely in oil. Sprinkle with a little more salt. Roast for 10-18 minutes until tender. Scatter with Parmesan if you wish, and serve immediately.
