Pannetone bread pudding
Introduction:
This is a more decadent take on a nursery dessert borne out of a need to use up stale bread. At the same time rich and light, this is great for Christmas entertaining. Add a little Marsala to the custard for further decadence. 
Ingredients:
6 slices of pannetone, toasted 6 eggs 120g caster sugar 500ml cream 500ml milk 1 vanilla pod, split granulated sugar
Method:
Preheat oven to 160ÂºC/Gas 3. Cut the pannetone into triangles and arrange, overlapping, in a buttered gratin dish. Mix the eggs and sugar together until pale. Pour the cream and milk into a pan, add the scraped out vanilla seeds and heat until it comes to the boil. Pour on the eggs and sugar and mix together to make custard. Pour the custard over and around the pannetone and let it soak in for about 15 minutes. Press the bread into the custard to help it soak in. Sprinkle with a little granulated sugar and bake for 30-40 minutes until firm. Serve with vanilla custard.
