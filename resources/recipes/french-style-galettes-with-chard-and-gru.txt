French style galettes with chard and Gruyère
Introduction:
Melting cheese, seasonal chard and a whole egg housed in a buckwheat pancake. These vegetarian galettes look impressive, but they’re simple to cook. Vary the filling according to whim: this is also good with spinach, Comté or Cheddar, ham or the usual sweet pancake fillings. 
Ingredients:
100g buckwheat flour good pinch salt 1 egg 300ml milk 400g chard, leaves stripped from their stalks 50g butter, melted sunflower oil, for oiling the pan 4 eggs 125g Gruyère or Cheddar, grated salt & pepper
Method:
To make the galette batter, sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the egg, then whisk, adding the milk a little at a time, until you have a smooth batter. Leave to rest for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, blanch and squeeze the chard leaves then roughly chop. Stir the melted butter into the batter. Heat a lightly oiled non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Put a quarter of the batter into the pan, rolling it around to cover the surface of the pan. Cook for about a minute until golden on the underside, then carefully flip the galette over. Crack an egg into the centre. Scatter a quarter of the chopped chard and grated cheese over the whole galette and season with salt and pepper. When the underside is cooked to golden brown, use a spatula then your fingertips to lift then fold the edges of the galette into the centre to form a square. Serve immediately, repeating with the remainder of the batter and filling.
