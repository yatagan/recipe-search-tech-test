Kohlrabi, carrot and sesame slaw
Introduction:
With its bulbous, alien appearance kohlrabi (also known as cabbage turnip) can be overlooked, but it has a radish-like crunch and a turnipy mildness that's easily enjoyed â€“ as in this light, fresh coleslaw. This stands up well as a packed lunch, or is brilliant accompaniment to a barbecue. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp sesame seeds 4 bunched carrots, peeled & cut into fine matchsticks 1 kohlrabi, peeled & cut into fine matchsticks 1-2 salad onions (depending on size), thinly sliced 2 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 1 tsp sesame oil 1 tsp rice wine vinegar 1 tsp soy sauce a good squeeze of lime juice 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan and gently heat them, stirring every now and then, for about a minute, until they are golden. Remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. Add the carrot, kohlrabi and onion and stir together. In a small bowl, whisk the chilli sauce, sesame oil, vinegar and soy. Season, and add a squeeze of lime juice to taste. Pour over the veg, add the coriander and toss together. Serve immediately.
