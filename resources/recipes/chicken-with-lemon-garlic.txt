Chicken with lemon and garlic
Introduction:
Small effort and high return: the ideal flavourful and low maintenance slow-roast chicken dish to get in the oven if you want to concentrate your efforts on entertaining guests or preparing other meal components. Pair with a tray of roasted root vegetables or a pile of creamy mash in winter, or a big green salad in summer. 
Ingredients:
4 chicken quarters, thighs & drumsticks separated or breasts halved or wings cut into joints 1 garlic bulb, separated into unpeeled cloves 2 lemons, cut into segments 15g fresh thyme 5 tbsp olive oil 150ml white wine black pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 140°C/Gas 1. Put the chicken pieces into a roasting tin and add the garlic cloves, lemon chunks and the thyme (leaves roughly pulled off the stalks). Add the oil and using your hands mix everything together, and spread out, skin side up, in a roasting tray. Pour over the white wine, add a little pepper, cover tightly with foil and put in the oven to cook for 3 hours. Baste every 40 minutes. Remove the foil from the roasting tin, and turn the oven up to 200°C/Gas 6. Cook the uncovered chicken for another 25-30 minutes, by which time the skin on the meat will have turned golden brown and the lemons will have begun to caramelize at the edges.
