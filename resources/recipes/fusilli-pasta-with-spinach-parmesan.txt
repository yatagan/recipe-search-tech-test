Fusilli pasta with spinach and Parmesan
Introduction:
A good vegetarian weeknight pasta – you can make the sauce in the time it takes the fusili to cook. Serve on its own or with a summer salad. This is also good with mascarpone in place of cream, and with a handful of peas, lightly blanched beans or fried mushrooms thrown in. 
Ingredients:
40g butter 1 onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed 300g spinach, washed & stalks removed 200ml vegetable stock 125ml double cream 400g fusilli pasta 50g Parmesan, grated or shaved salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a pan. Sauté the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes or so until soft. Add the spinach, stock and cream, bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes. Remove from the heat and leave until cool enough to transfer to a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Season. In a pan of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to the instructions, until al dente. Toss the cooked pasta with the spinach mixture and serve with grated or shaved Parmesan.
