2 tbsp olive oil juice of Â½ lemon 300g rocket 30g Parmesan cheese, cut into slivers 8 thin slices of prosciutto (or serrano ham) salt & pepper
Method:
Whisk the olive oil and lemon juice together with some salt and pepper to make a dressing. Put the rocket leaves in a bowl and toss with the dressing. Divide between 4 plates, sprinkle with the Parmesan slivers and drape each serving with 2 slices of prosciutto.
