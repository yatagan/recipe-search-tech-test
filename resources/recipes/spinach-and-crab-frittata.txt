Spinach and crab frittata
Introduction:
This is ideal for brunch or a light lunch. Go easy on the cheese, so the crab taste isn't crowded. For an Asian version, omit the Parmesan and nutmeg, add spring onions and chilli and serve drizzled with oyster sauce. Another good variation is to include diced roasted red peppers. 
Ingredients:
400g spinach, stalks removed 3 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed large pinch nutmeg, freshly grated 6 eggs 1 tbsp fresh herbs, such as coriander, parsley or chives, finely chopped 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese, grated 200g fresh white crab meat salt & pepper
Method:
Blanch spinach leaves in a large pan of boiling salted water for 1 minute, then drain and refresh in cold water. Squeeze out the excess water, chop the spinach roughly and set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and garlic and cook over a moderate heat for 5â€“10 minutes, until soft. Stir in the spinach and season well with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then remove from the heat. Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl. Mix in the spinach and onion, plus the herbs, Parmesan, crab meat and some seasoning. Heat the remaining olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the frittata mixture and reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the frittata is set underneath and still slightly runny on top, running a spatula around the sides to make sure it is not sticking. Place the pan under a hot grill for 1 minute to cook the top. Slide the frittata out of the pan and leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then cut it into wedges to serve.
