Roasted swede with maple syrup
Introduction:
Roasting swede is a good way of intensifying its flavour, and maple syrup points up its lovely sweetness. Serve this with cooked gammon ham or ham hock, thick slices of bacon, or with roast meat. You could sprinkle on a little smoked paprika before putting it in the oven to add more of an edge . 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 swede, peeled & cut into roast potato sized chunks 3 tbsp maple syrup
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a flameproof baking tray or large casserole dish over a hob; add the swede and coat with oil. Carefully drizzle over 3 tablespoons maple syrup and toss well. Be careful not to catch and burn the syrup. Roast in the oven turning at intervals for 45 minutes until crisp and golden.
