Fennel, black olive and orange salad
Introduction:
A salad of beauty and contrast: salty olives, aniseed fennel and sweet oranges in a sharp dressing. If you have only a couple of fennel bulbs this is the way to serve them. You could also use blood oranges when they're in season. 
Ingredients:
3 oranges 3 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 bulbs fennel, trimmed 12 black olives, stoned 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped, plus a few leaves to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Cut off all the skin and white pith from the oranges, then cut out the segments from between the membrane, working over a bowl to catch the juice. Squeeze out the membranes into the bowl when you have finished, to extract the remaining juice. Pour the juice into a separate bowl and whisk in the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper to make a dressing. Finely shred the fennel with a sharp knife or on a mandolin. Mix with the orange segments, olives, parsley and dressing. Adjust the seasoning and serve.
