Roast teriyaki beef
Introduction:
Teriyaki is a Japanese cooking technique involving a glaze of soy sauce, mirin and sugar. Marinating the beef takes a bit of patience, but is deeply rewarding. This is equally good cold and thinly sliced with a salad of peppery leaves such as watercress, mustard leaves, rocket and mizuna; or eaten hot with a sauce made with the marinade and served over mash flavoured with a hint of wasabi paste. 
Ingredients:
1.1kg boneless beef roasting joint 4 tbsp kikkoman soy sauce 4 tbsp dry sherry 2 tbsp mirin 1 tsp brown sugar 2 tbsp olive oil 3cm fresh ginger, grated 2 garlic cloves, crushed black pepper salt & pepper
Method:
Marinade the beef joint in all the ingredients overnight or for at least a couple of hours. Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Remove the joint from the marinade (reserve), pat dry and roast for 20 minutes then reduce the oven to 190°C/Gas 4 for the remainder of the roasting time (see note). Rest the meat in a warm place; pour the reserved marinade into the roasting tray with the meat residues and scrape together into a sauce. Cook and taste, adjusting the seasoning if necessary and adding a touch of stock. Strain then serve over the beef.
