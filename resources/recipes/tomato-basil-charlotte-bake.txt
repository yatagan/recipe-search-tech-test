Tomato and basil charlotte bake
Introduction:
An easy recipe for baked tomatoes and golden, buttery breadcrumbs. This goes well with polenta and a rocket leaf salad for a light dinner. You can also make it with cherry tomatoes, which will be sweeter and will need a slightly shorter cooking time. 
Ingredients:
450g tomatoes, thinly sliced 1½ tbsp fresh basil, chopped 2 tsp caster sugar 125g breadcrumbs 50g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. In a buttered gratin or baking dish layer some of the tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, basil leaves and some of the sugar. Cover with some of the breadcrumbs and dot with butter. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with breadcrumbs and butter. Bake for 30 minutes or until the top has browned.
