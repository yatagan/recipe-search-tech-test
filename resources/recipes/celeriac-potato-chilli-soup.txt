1 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 1 small celeriac, peeled & chopped 2- 3 medium to large potatoes, peeled & chopped 1-2 red chillies, deseeded & chopped 1.2 -1.5 litres veg stock yoghurt or cr&egraveme fraîche coriander, chopped, to serve (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and fry gently for a few minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and fry for a couple more minutes. Add the rest of the veg and chillies. Pour in the veg stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the veg is tender. Blend until smooth. Season. Thin with a little extra stock if too thick. Serve with a swirl of yoghurt or cr&eacuteme fraîche and sprinkle with chopped coriander.
