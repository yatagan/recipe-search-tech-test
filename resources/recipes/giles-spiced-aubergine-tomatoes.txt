Giles’ spiced aubergine and tomatoes
Introduction:
This dish has a jammy unctuousness that leaves it open to many uses. It is worth making a lot in one go as it takes time to cook, keeps well in the fridge and always leaves you regretting it if you don't. It can be scaled up and down depending how many aubergines you have. Serve alongside meat or fish dishes, use as a dip, spread or chutney. It can stand as a dish in its own right with a few dressed lentils or can be scooped into homemade kebabs, falafels and pitta pockets. It even works on toast with a fried egg for breakfast, I'd go for mint tea rather than earl grey though. 
Ingredients:
1 aubergine 1 small onion, diced 2 garlic clove, chopped 2 tsp of cumin seeds 1 tsp of coriander seed pinch of ground cinnamon 200g chopped tomatoes dried chilli flakes, optional salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the green top and cut the aubergine into 2cm chunks. Roast at 180˚C/Gas 4 with plenty of olive oil, salt and pepper for 20-30 minutes or until tender and golden. Turn occasionally, a dash of water or a slug more oil may be needed half way through if they look like they are sticking. Meanwhile, set the onions to sweat in a pan with a little oil until soft, 5 -10 minutes. In a dry pan fry the cumin and coriander seeds till they start to toast and smell fragrant. Grind them in a spice grinder or pestle and mortar. Add the spices and the garlic to the onions and cook for 1 minute. Tip in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Add the roasted Aubergines and gently simmer on a low heat for 30-40 minutes adding a dash of water here and there if it looks like it is drying out too much and starting to stick. Season with salt and pepper. You should end up with a dark red, sticky pan of spicy joy. Feel free to put a pinch of dried chilli into the mix if you want it to have a bit of a kick.
