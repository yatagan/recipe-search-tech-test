Potato, mozzarella and tomato salad
Introduction:
This is a quick, easy side dish, and full of flavour. It's best eaten warm or at room temperature, rather than just out of the fridge. One very nice addition is to stir through a tablespoon of basil pesto instead of, or as well as, the fresh basil garnish. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped 400g salad potatoes e.g. Charlotte, cleaned 400ml veg stock 125g mozzarella cheese, torn into small pieces 400g tomatoes, chopped, or halved if using cherry handful fresh basil, chopped 60g pine nuts, toasted salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Fry the garlic and potatoes for 2 minutes. Add the stock. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are cooked through. Remove the potatoes from the stock and turn up the heat. Reduce the liquid slightly (you need about 2 tablespoons). Add the potatoes back to the pan with the mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. Stir until the cheese has melted. Season and top with pine nuts to serve.
