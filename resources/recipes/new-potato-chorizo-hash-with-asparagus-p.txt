New potato and chorizo hash with asparagus and poached egg
Introduction:
A quick brunch, lunch or dinner. This gives a wonderful range of textures and flavours from hardly any ingredients. Use the freshest eggs possible for poaching - the white will set around the yolk more easily. This is verly adaptable: you can substitute asparagus for kale, spring greens or spinach here, and bacon or pancetta for the chorizo. Sweetcorn is another good addition. 
Ingredients:
600g new potatoes, scrubbed & halved or quartered if large 2 tbsp olive oil 1 red onion, chopped 250g cooking chorizo sausages, skin removed & meat crumbled 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 250g asparagus splash of sherry vinegar ½ tsp smoked paprika splash of white wine or cider vinegar 2 eggs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Boil the potatoes in salted water for 12-15 minutes, until tender. Drain and lightly crush with a masher or fork. While the potatoes are cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan and cook the onion slowly for 6 minutes without colouring. Add the chorizo and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the potatoes and warm through. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, toss the asparagus in 1 tablespoon of oil in a baking dish. Add a splash of sherry vinegar, the paprika and season. Roast for 10-15 minutes, until just tender (or griddle for 5 minutes). Bring a pan of water to a slow rolling boil. Add a good splash of white wine or cider vinegar. Crack the eggs into individual small bowls. Use a spoon to swirl the water and drop the eggs in, one at a time. Cook for 2½ minutes for a runny yolk. While the eggs are cooking, plate the potatoes and asparagus. Remove the eggs and serve on the potatoes. Sprinkle the eggs with some extra salt.
