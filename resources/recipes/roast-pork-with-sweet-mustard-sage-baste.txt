Roast pork with sweet mustard and sage baste
Introduction:
This sweet pork roast is an excellent dish for Sunday lunch. Serve with braised leeks and new potatoes - or some steamed broad beans, and a generous spoonful of apple sauce. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp honey 2 tbsp wholegrain mustard 2 tbsp olive oil 1.1kg pork leg roasting joint bunch fresh sage leaves 250ml cider or apple juice salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Mix together the honey, grain mustard and olive oil. Sit the pork joint in a roasting tin and brush with the mixture, scatter with sage leaves and transfer to the oven for about 1 hour 20 minutes or until the meat is completely cooked and the juices run clear when tested with a skewer. Baste at least once during cooking time. Allow to rest for 10 minutes in a warm place before carving. While the pork rests, return the roasting pan to the stove and add 250ml apple juice or cider, stir and scrape around the tin to incorporate all the sticky meat juices - taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, serve over thick slices of pork on warmed plates.
