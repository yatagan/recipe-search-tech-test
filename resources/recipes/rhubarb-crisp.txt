Rhubarb crisp
Introduction:
This is the American version of the rhubarb crumble and it's just as delicious as the home-grown classic. Serve it with oodles of cream or custard, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
Ingredients:
200g soft brown sugar 125g flour 75g rolled oats 100g butter, melted 1 tsp ground cinnamon 600g rhubarb, sliced into 1cm pieces 200g caster sugar juice of 1 orange 100ml water 2 tsp cornflour few drops vanilla essence
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Combine the brown sugar, flour, oats, butter and cinnamon in a mixing bowl until crumbly. Press half of the mixture into the base of a 20cm square baking dish and top with the sliced rhubarb. In a pan combine the caster sugar, orange juice, water, cornflour and vanilla. Bring up to a simmer and pour over the rhubarb. Top with the remaining crumbly oat mix and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes.
