green bean noodles with courgettes and tofu
Introduction:
Fresh, light and health-giving Thai noodle soup. The list of ingredients may look daunting, but once they’re assembled most of your work is done – and you will thank yourself when you sit down to a fragrant, steaming bowl. Use firm tofu for the best aesthetic result: the softer kind may fall apart (though this won’t harm the taste). 
Ingredients:
1 stock cube/ miso boullion in 700ml boiling water 25g ginger, finely sliced 1 red chilli, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, sliced 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce ½ tsp Chinese 5 spice 1 tsp brown sugar 1 stick lemongrass, roughly bashed 1 large courgette 200g green beans, finely sliced 200g tofu, cut into 1cm dice 200g rice noodles, cooked & cooled 20g fresh coriander, chopped 20g fresh basil, leaves picked 1 tsp sesame seeds 1 lime
Method:
Tip the stock into a pan with the ginger, ⅔ of the chilli, garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 5 spice, brown sugar and lemongrass. Simmer for 15 minutes. Peel the courgette in to long thin strips and slice finely. Remove the lemongrass stalks and discard them. Add the green beans and cook for 4 minutes until they are tender. Add the tofu and courgette, bring back to the simmer and remove from the heat. Split the cooked noodles evenly between two deep bowls. Divide the coriander and the basil leaves between the noodles. Ladle the hot stock into the bowls making sure that you evenly divide the courgette, tofu and beans. Garnish with the remaining chopped chilli, the sesame seeds and a wedge or two of lime.
