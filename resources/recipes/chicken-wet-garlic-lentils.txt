Griddled chicken with wet garlic and herbed lentils
Introduction:
Wet garlic is the first garlic crop of the season, picked but not hung up to dry. It's sweet and mild with a creamier texture than dried garlic. This chicken and lentil dish goes well with roasted bunched carrots. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil 2 onions, diced 2 carrots, diced 2 sticks celery, diced a good handful of shredded wet garlic leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme 4 sage leaves, shredded 300g Puy lentils, rinsed & drained 4 tomatoes, chopped splash of sherry or balsamic vinegar large handful fresh parsley, chopped 4 chicken breasts oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a heavy pan. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, thyme and sage. Cook very gently for 8 minutes to soften the veg. Add the lentils. Pour over just enough water to cover, then another 2cm on top. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover and simmer very gently for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the tomatoes. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, until the lentils are tender. Season well. Add a splash more water if needed. The lentils should be cooked through, and have a soupy consistency. Once the tomatoes have been added, heat a griddle or heavy frying pan, or use the BBQ. Follow the natural slit in the middle of the chicken breast and cut almost in half with a sharp knife. If particularly large, place it between 2 sheets of clingfilm and use a rolling pin to bash it a little thinner. Open it out and rub a little oil, salt and pepper onto both sides of the chicken. Fry or BBQ for about 5 minutes on both sides until cooked through. Stir the vinegar and parsley into the lentils. Serve with the chicken.
