Tarragon and garlic stuffing for chicken
Introduction:
Tarragon and garlic make great combination with chicken. This stuffing is based on a chicken dish from Spago, a famous restaurant in Beverley Hills, which used parsley instead of tarragon. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic bulb 1 tbsp tarragon, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Separate the garlic cloves, peel them and place in a small pan. Cover with water and simmer for about 40 minutes, topping up with more water if necessary, until the garlic is very soft. Drain the garlic and crush to a paste with the flat of a knife. Mix with the tarragon and season well. The stuffing should be smeared between the skin and flesh of the breast and leg. A natural pocket can be found by easing the skin away from the flesh. With one hand and a tablespoon of the stuffing, venture under the skin, pushing the stuffing in and being sure not to break the skin.
