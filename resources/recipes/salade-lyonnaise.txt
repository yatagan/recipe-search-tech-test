Salade Lyonnaise
Introduction:
Hailing from the bistros of Lyon, this is a healthy, hearty, everyday salad. Traditionally it's made with curly endive but there's no reason why you shouldn't use mixed salad leaves or baby spinach instead. 
Ingredients:
1/2 ciabatta loaf (or baguette), cut into 1.5cm cubes 2 tbsp olive oil 250g streaky bacon, cut into lardons 1 head of curly endive 4 eggs 1 tbsp chopped chives for the vinaigrette: 4 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 2 tsp Dijon mustard 1 tsp sugar
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Mix the bread cubes with the olive oil, spread them out on a baking tray and bake in the oven for 10 minutes, until crisp and slightly browned. Fry the bacon lardons until the fat starts to run out and the bacon is lightly coloured. Drain on kitchen paper. Wash the curly endive and dry well. Mix the dressing ingredients together by whisking well or shaking in a jam jar. Poach the eggs in gently simmering water for 3–4 minutes so that they are still soft. Put the curly endive in a bowl and dress with 3–4 tablespoons of the vinaigrette, so that the leaves are lightly coated. Divide between 4 plates and sprinkle with the bacon and croutons. Top with the poached eggs and then scatter with the chives. Drizzle with more of the vinaigrette, if you like, and serve immediately.
