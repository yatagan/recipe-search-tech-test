Parsnip and leek korma
Introduction:
This mild but warmly spicy recipe turns everyday veg into a creamy, flavourful and comforting dinner in less than 30 minutes. It makes a good vegetarian main, either alone or with rice or naan bread and pickle or chutney. Omit the yoghurt (or use coconut yoghurt) and this is also suitable for vegans. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 leek, finely shredded 1 very large parsnip or more smaller (about 300g), cut into batons 1 tbsp mild curry powder ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground coriander 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 5cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 50g ground almonds 450g yoghurt 1 tin chickpeas, rinsed & drained 1 lime, juice to taste handful fresh coriander leaves handful flaked almonds, toasted salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan. Add the leek and fry on a low heat for 5 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the parsnip and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the curry powder, cumin, coriander, garlic and ginger. Stir for 1 minute. With the heat right down, add the almonds and half the pot of yoghurt. Stir, then add 150ml water and half the chickpeas (save the rest for other meals or lunchbox salads). Season with a little salt. Bring gently up to a low boil, not much more than a simmer. Cook for about 10-12 minutes, until the parsnips are just tender. Keep an eye on the liquid – you don’t want the sauce too runny, but add a splash more water if it looks like it’s getting too thick and gloopy. Taste for salt, add a good squeeze of lime juice and stir in the fresh coriander leaves to serve. Sprinkle over some toasted flaked almonds to serve.
