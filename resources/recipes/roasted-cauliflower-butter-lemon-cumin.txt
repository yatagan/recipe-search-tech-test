roasted cauliflower with butter, lemon and cumin
Introduction:
The cumin gives this dish an Indian feel but the spicing is so subtle that it works in the most traditional of meals. The flavour combination suits roasted parsnips too. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, split into florets zest & juice of 1 lemon, plus the juice of another 80g butter, diced 2 rounded tsp cumin seeds, toasted & ground (or 2 tsp ready-ground cumin) handful of flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped salt & black pepper
Method:
Heat the oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Season the cauliflower with salt and pepper and spread it out in a roasting tin. Roast in the oven for 12–15 minutes until lightly golden. Cover with foil if it’s browning too much. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice. Stir in the butter, cumin and lemon zest and roast for a further 3–5 minutes, until tender but so it still has bite. Remove the tin from the oven and stir in the parsley, then add the remaining lemon juice a little at a time to taste.
