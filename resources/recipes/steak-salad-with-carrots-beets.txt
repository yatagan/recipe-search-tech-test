Steak salad with carrots, beets & orange & ginger dressing
Introduction:
This is a speedily cooked, light and nutritious supper option, great for busy days. Our alfalfa sprouts contain lots of essential nutrients and the seeds add a little extra too. They’re great for adding interest and crunch to winter salads.
Ingredients:
1 orange 1 tbsp honey piece fresh ginger olive oil 2 large carrots 1 large or 2 smaller beetroot ½ pack alfalfa sprouts ½ tin chickpeas 2 rump steaks oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or olive oil 3 tbsp mixed seeds salt & pepper
Method:
Squeeze the juice from half the orange into a large bowl. Stir in the honey. Peel and finely grate 2 teaspoons worth of ginger. Add to the bowl along with 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk together with a fork. Peel and coarsely grate the carrot and beetroot. Add the carrot to the same bowl (save the beetroot until just before you serve, as it can make the whole salad pink). Wash ½ the pack of alfalfa. Rinse and drain the tin of chickpeas. Rub the steaks with a little oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the mixed seeds in a dry frying pan. Lightly toast them on a low heat for no more than 1 minute. Remove to a small bowl. Heat the pan again. When very hot, fry the steaks for about 1-2 minutes on each side for rare or medium-rare (cook for a little longer if you like your steak more well done). Remove to a plate to rest. Add the alfalfa, chickpeas and mixed seeds to the carrot. Gently toss together, adding the beetroot at the last minute. Serve with the steak, either in one whole piece or sliced, as you prefer.
