Thai carrot, red onion and noodle salad with peanuts
Introduction:
This refreshing, exotic salad requires a bit of prepping but it's simple to make. Eat it at room temperature on its own for a light vegetarian lunch or dinner. As well as rice noodles you could use soba (made from buckwheat) or udon (made from wheat). Use soy sauce in place to fish sauce if you're a vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
200g rice noodles 1 tbsp boiling water 1 heaped tbsp caster sugar 1 tbsp Thai fish sauce (vegetarians use light soy sauce) juice of 1-2 limes 1 small hot chilli, deseeded & very finely chopped 1 tsp sunflower or vegetable oil large handful fresh coriander large handful fresh basil small handful fresh mint 3 large carrots, cleaned & cut into fine matchsticks ½ red onion, very finely sliced ½-1 large red chilli (to taste), deseeded & cut into fine slivers 3 tbsp salted peanuts, lightly crushed in a plastic bag with a rolling pin
Method:
Place the noodles in a large heatproof bowl and pour over boiling water. Leave for 5-10 minutes until noodles are soft enough to eat but still with some bite. Drain in a sieve, rinse under cold water, and leave to drain again. Make the dressing: in a small bowl or jug pour the 1 tablespoon boiling water over the sugar and stir until dissolved. Add the fish or soy sauce, most of the lime juice, half the chilli and the oil. Stir and taste – the dressing should taste hot, salty, sweet and sour. Add more chilli and lime to taste. Roughly chop the herbs. Mix the noodles with vegetables and most of the herbs, reserving a few leaves for garnish. Pour over the dressing and mix again. Turn salad onto a platter or bowl, scatter over the peanuts and remaining herbs and serve.
