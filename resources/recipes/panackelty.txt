Panackelty
Introduction:
This hearty dish from the northeast of England has been around forever and there's no definitive recipe; it's a great way of using up leftover meat or odd bits of veg. Legend has it that it was the fuel the Jarrow marchers survived on. It's good with buttered cabbage. 
Ingredients:
2 onions, chopped 1 tbsp lard or dripping 200g corned beef, leftover meat or sausages, sliced 1 carrot, sliced (plus any other root vegetables you have; swede is especially good) 2 large potatoes, peeled & sliced 500ml hot stock salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180ÂºC/Gas 4. Fry the onions in the fat for 10 minutes, until soft, then place in an ovenproof dish. Add the meat, then the carrot and any leftover vegetables. Finish off with a layer of sliced potatoes, seasoning each layer as you go. Pour in your hot stock and bake in oven 1 hour, until everything is tender.
