Garlic and yoghurt dressing for salad leaves
Introduction:
This straightforward salad dressing goes well with our mixed leaf salad packs or with a simple lettuce salad. It's also good mixed with new potatoes boiled for 10 minutes until tender. 
Ingredients:
1-2 garlic cloves, depending on your preference 2 tbsp white or red wine vinegar 6 tbsp olive oil 6 tbsp plain yoghurt salt & pepper
Method:
Crush or finely chop the garlic and mix in a small bowl with the vinegar and oil. Whisk in the yoghurt until you have a creamy dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Alternatively, you can shake all the ingredients together in a jam jar. Keep in the fridge and whisk or shake just before use. Toss in a large bowl with salad leaves, using just enough to lightly coat them.
