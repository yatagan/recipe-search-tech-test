Marrow with tomato and onion
Introduction:
Marrow flesh is very good at this absorbing tomatoey, herby sauce. Served with potatoes or grains, this makes a very healthy, tasty main. It's particularly good topped with melted cheese. When buying marrows, go for ones that feel heavy for their size and that aren’t too big. The older ones can get a little watery and bitter. 
Ingredients:
2 medium onions, roughly chopped 25g butter 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 medium marrow, peeled, deseeded & diced 6 large tomatoes, skinned & chopped 1 tbsp tomato purée 1 tbsp mixed herbs salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the onions gently in butter with the garlic for 5 minutes. Add the marrow and cook for another 5 minutes. Stir in all the remaining ingredients and simmer gently for around 30 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
