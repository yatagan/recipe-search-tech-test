Spinach and mushroom lasagne
Introduction:
This creamy, vegetarian lasagne full of spinach and mushrooms is a family favourite. It takes a few moments to assemble, but can be made ahead of time then put in the oven half an hour before you want to eat. Any leftovers re-heat or freeze well. Use other greens in this if you don't have spinach in your veg box e.g. chard or kale. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for greasing 300g spinach 300g mushrooms, sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 400g tin chopped tomatoes basil & oregano (handful of fresh or 1 tsp of dried) 400ml crème fraîche ½ tsp nutmeg, grated 300g lasagne (fresh or non pre-cook sheets) 150g Cheddar cheese, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 5. Heat half the oil in a large pan. Add the spinach leaves and cook for a couple of minutes until the spinach has wilted. Remove the spinach from the pan into a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add the rest of the oil to the pan with the mushrooms and garlic and cook for 5 minutes or so until the mushrooms are browned. Stir in the tomatoes and herbs, bring to the boil and cook for a couple of minutes more. Remove from the heat, season to taste. Add to the spinach. Mix the crème fraîche with the nutmeg and season. Lightly oil an ovenproof dish. Starting with the lasagne sheets first, layer with the mushroom and spinach mixture, the crème fraîche and cheese (at least a couple of layers of each). Finish with a final layer of lasagne and spread over a little crème fraîche and cheese to cover. Bake for 30-40 minutes or so until the lasagne is tender and the top golden brown.
