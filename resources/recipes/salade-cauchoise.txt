Salade cauchoise
Introduction:
This easy-to-make and inexpensive warm salad is a speciality of Pays de Caux in Normandy. Use the very best potatoes you can find because you'll really notice them – they should be firm and fresh, with no give when you press their skins. If you don't have or don't like celery, fennel bulbs make an excellent alternative. 
Ingredients:
750g waxy salad potatoes or new potatoes 6 stalks celery 100g cooked ham a few sprigs fresh chervil or fresh parsley 4 tsp cider vinegar 1 1/2 tbsp chopped fresh chives 8 tbsp crème fraîche or fromage frais salt & pepper
Method:
To make the dressing stir the vinegar, herbs, salt and pepper into the crème fraîche or fromage frais. Taste and adjust seasoning. Scrub the potatoes and steam until tender. While still warm, cut into cubes and toss in half the dressing. Leave to cool. Slice the celery and cut the ham into strips. Mix with the potatoes and enough extra dressing to coat without overwhelming. Spoon into a serving dish and arrange sprigs of chervil or parsley on top.
