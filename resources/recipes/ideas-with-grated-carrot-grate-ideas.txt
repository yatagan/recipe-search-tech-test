Ideas with grated carrot (grate ideas)
Introduction:
The humble carrot is our totemic vegetable. It litters our logos and livery and is never absent from our barns in one form or another. Here are a few ideas to insure that, armed with a grater, you’ll never leave them rattling around in the bottom of the box at the end of week again.
Ingredients:
carrots
Method:
The sandwich: Mix a handful of grated carrot with some crumbled cheddar and a spoonful of sweet chutney (mango works surprisingly well). Spread into a sarnie with some crisp salad leaf. The side salad: Mix 2 grated carrots with some grated ginger, a pinch of ground cardamom and the juice of half a lemon. Scatter over some toasted mixed seeds and chopped green herbs. The fritter: Mix 2 grated carrots with 2 tablespoons of gram flour, 1 small grated red onion, ½ teaspoon of cumin, some chopped parsley, salt & pepper. Mix and press into small patties, fry until golden on both sides. The secret ingredient: Add a handful of grated carrot into sturdy slow-cook dishes such as pies, stews or chillies. Don’t forget that carrots are a key ingredient for a stock pot, so any clean peel or gratings are always welcome.
