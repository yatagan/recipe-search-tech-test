Spiced roast new potatoes and aioli
Introduction:
Boiled then roasted with spices, these new potatoes are good as a snack with drinks, for a picnic or served without the aioli as a side dish to fish or chicken. The potatoes lose their crispness when cold but still taste good. 
Ingredients:
600g-700g new potatoes, washed & halved if large 2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp ground paprika ¼-½ tsp cayenne pepper 6 tbsp mayonnaise 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed to a purée juice ½ lemon (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas 8. Boil the potatoes until tender. Drain and cool. Combine the spices with some salt and black pepper and place in a bowl. Rub the potatoes with oil until lightly coated, then roll in the spice mix and place straight onto an oiled baking sheet or roasting tray. Roast for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are hot and crisp. Combine mayonnaise, crushed garlic and lemon juice (if using) to make an aioli. Serve with the potatoes.
