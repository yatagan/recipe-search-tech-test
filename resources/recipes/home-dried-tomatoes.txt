Home-dried tomatoes
Introduction:
A simple way of producing your own equivalent of sun-dried tomatoes – and a brilliant solution to an over-bountiful tomato harvest. Oven-dried tomatoes have a deep, intense flavour that's particularly welcome in the winter months. They're excellent tossed in a salad, baked in tarts or mixed with pasta. Dry as many tomatoes as you can while the oven's on; they keep well for at least six months. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil 16 tomatoes 1 tbsp caster sugar
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Drizzle about half the olive oil over 2 baking trays. Cut the tomatoes lengthways in half, then slide the knife around the inside of each one and remove the pulp and pips. Arrange the tomato halves on the trays so that they are close but not touching. Drizzle the remaining oil over the top and sprinkle with the sugar and a little salt. Put the trays the oven and cook for about 45 minutes; the tomatoes should look shrunken and slightly coloured when they are done. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. To store, pack the tomatoes into jars and cover completely with good-quality olive oil. They will keep for about 6 months without refrigeration.
