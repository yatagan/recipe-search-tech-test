Leek pasty
Introduction:
If you start off with good shopbought pastry this recipe is not too much of a faff and the results are worth it – rich, crisp and melty-cented. These pasties could be made lighter by using puff instead of shortcrust pastry, although they'd be less robust for picnics. The suggested filling is just a starting point: try adding mushrooms, or substituting chicken for bacon. This is good hot or cold. 
Ingredients:
500g leeks, white part only 1 tsp white wine vinegar 2 smoked streaky bacon rashers 30g butter 30g plain flour 300ml milk 225g shortcrust pastry 1 egg yolk beaten egg for glazing salt and pepper
Method:
Shred the leeks and marinate for 30 minutes in the vinegar and enough water to cover. Drain. Dice the bacon and fry in butter for a few minutes. Stir in the flour and cook until beginning to brown. Gradually pour in the milk stirring all the time. Add the leeks, season and cook for 30 minutes over a low heat. Leave to get cold. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Roll out the pastry into a circle. Transfer to a floured baking sheet. Beat the egg yolk, add to the leek mixture and spoon it onto one half of the pastry. Brush the edges with some beaten egg and fold it over to enclose the filling. Seal the edges, glaze with beaten egg and bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
