Rhubarb tart 
Introduction:
You could use this to fill a puff pastry case for a tart that's fragile, but mouth-wateringly light, or a shortcrust pastry case for something a bit more substantial and robust. Bake for about 30 minutes at 190°C/Gas 5, until the pasty is golden and the filling just set. 
Ingredients:
250g shortcrust pastry 500g rhubarb 150g caster sugar 4 egg yolks 150g butter 150g ground almonds 6 egg whites
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Roll out the pastry and fill a tart tin. Chill. Cut the rhubarb into 5mm pieces and mix with half the sugar. Mix the egg yolks with the butter, remaining sugar and almonds, then add the rhubarb. Finally whisk the egg whites and then fold into the rhubarb mixture. Fill the pastry case and bake for 20 minutes.
