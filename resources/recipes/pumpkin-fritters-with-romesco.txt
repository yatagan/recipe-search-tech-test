Pumpkin fritters with romesco
Introduction:
These fritters are simple to prepare and the romesco is a delicious accompaniment, but can be substituted for a simple mayonnaise mixed with paprika and garlic. James has chosen to make the romesco to have a mix of nuts rather than using just almonds, and included cashews which add a creamy taste to the sauce. 
Ingredients:
For the romesco: 2 red peppers 2 garlic cloves, puréed handful of walnuts, almonds & hazelnuts, toasted 2 tbsp red or sherry wine vinegar 2 tbsp olive oil pinch of paprika salt & black pepper, to taste For the fritters: 150g potato 300g pumpkin flesh 1 red onion 1 tsp salt 2 eggs ½ tsp black pepper, ground ½ tsp garam masala 3 tbsp gram flour 1 tsp smoked paprika bunch of parsley, chopped ½ tsp baking powder vegetable oil, for frying
Method:
First, make the romesco. Heat the oven to the hottest it will go. Rub the peppers with oil, season with salt then roast until well browned. Remove and place in a bowl, covering with cling film to steam the peppers and help the skins slip off. Skin and deseed. Finally, pulse all the ingredients in a food processor. You can make a smooth or chunky sauce; I prefer the latter. To make the fritters, start by grating the potato and pumpkin, then very finely slice the red onion and toss together with salt. Allow to sit for 20 mins. Mix the rest of the ingredients to a batter. Squeeze the salted veg in a clean tea towel and stir into the batter. Heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Spoon dollops of the mix and fry on each side for around 4 - 5 mins until browned. Make sure they are cooked through as you don’t want the middle to be raw; bake in the oven if needs be.
