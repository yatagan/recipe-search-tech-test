Oven baked root veg
Introduction:
This dish is a good way turning odds and ends of root veg into a rich vegetarian main. All it needs is a crisp green salad and a side of grain or quinoa for a complete dinner. It doesn't necessarily have to be eaten hot – any leftovers are nice tossed with salad leaves and a balsamic dressing. 
Ingredients:
100g butter, softened zest of 1 lemon 2 garlic cloves, crushed small handful fresh thyme, chopped, or use 1 tsp dried 100g cheese, Gruyère or Emmental 1.2kg mixed root veg, peeled & thinly sliced salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 170°C/Gas 3½. Butter a baking dish. In a bowl, mash the butter with the lemon, garlic, herbs and cheese. Layer the veg, dotting with the butter mixture and seasoning with salt and pepper as you go. Cover tightly with foil and bake in the oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes or so, until the vegetables are tender and the top crisps up.
