Curly kale pesto
Introduction:
You can make this pesto with raw or cooked kale. The raw version has more of a bitter, mineral taste, the cooked is sweeter but arguably less complex. Youâ€™ll need more kale if you intend to cook it as it will need blanching, cooling and squeezing. This pesto is wonderful thrown in a pan with pasta, maybe accompanied by some roasted squash or fried mushrooms. Try adding a blob or two to a hearty stew as a garnish or to bruschetta with some cured meats or roasted tomatoes. 
Ingredients:
100g kale/200g if cooking 60g Parmesan 60g toasted nuts (pine nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts or almonds) 1 garlic clove olive oil 1 lemon
Method:
Strip the leaves from the kale, wash them well and discard the stalks. If cooking, blanch the kale in boiling water for 1 minute until wilted. Drain and cool in cold water. Squeeze dry with your hands. Put the kale, Parmesan, nuts and garlic in a processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add olive oil until you achieve a thick pesto consistency. Season with salt, pepper and a dash or two of lemon juice to your tastes.
