Pulled beef chilli
Introduction:
Fortunately, as with most cuts of meat, there are many different ways to cook it. Pulled beef is not for the faint hearted; the concentration of beefiness and marinade making it perfect for a roll with slaw and gherkins. A rub of garlic and onion powder, mustard powder, smoked paprika, brown sugar and salt and pepper would be fairly standard. It will take about 4 hours at 140°C. Alternatively, and equally good, is pulled beef chilli. 
Ingredients:
1kg beef brisket 2 tbsp sunflower oil 5 garlic cloves, crushed 2 Spanish onions, halved & thinly sliced 2 tsp chilli flakes 2 tsp ground coriander 2 tsp ground cumin 50ml cider vinegar 3 carrots, finely diced 300ml water 2 tins chopped tomatoes 1 red chilli 2 bay leaves 1 tbsp molasses 2 tins kidney beans, drained
Method:
Unwrap the beef and season generously on both sides. Heat a large, heavy frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the oil and brown the meat on both sides. Transfer the meat to a slow cooker or lidded casserole. If using the latter, put the casserole in the oven at 130°C/Gas Mark ¾. Add garlic, onion, carrot, chilli flakes, coriander, and cumin to the frying pan and cook for a minute or so until nicely fragrant. Add vinegar and boil until it’s almost gone, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in water, tomatoes, red chilli, bay leaves, and molasses and cook for 2 hours (in the oven) or 6 hours in the slow cooker. Add the beans and mix as well as you can and cook for another 40 minutes. Remove the beef, place on a board and pull apart with forks or fingers. Stir it back into the sauce and cook for another 15 minutes.
