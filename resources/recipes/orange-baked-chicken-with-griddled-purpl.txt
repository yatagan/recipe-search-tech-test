Orange baked chicken with griddled purple sprouting broccoli
Introduction:
The combination of soy, orange juice and tomato purée gives the chicken a lovely sweet-savoury edge. Eat with rice or quinoa or just on its own with the purple sprouting broccoli. If you're outside the purple sprouting broccoli season, this is also great with normal broccoli cut into florets. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 4 chicken pieces (thighs or drumsticks), bone in & skin on 20g butter 1 onion, chopped juice of 1 orange 1 tbsp tomato purée 12 black olives, pitted but whole 1 tbsp light soy sauce 150-200g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed & cut into similar sized pieces olive oil for griddling small handful fresh coriander or fresh parsley leaves, to serve (optional)
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry the chicken, in batches if necessary, until the skin is coloured. Transfer to a plate or the baking dish, if using. Add the butter to the pan, then add the onion and fry on a low to medium heat for a few minutes to soften. Add the orange juice, tomato purée, olives and soy sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then pour over the chicken and cover. Cook in the oven for 35-40 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. While the meat is cooking, put the purple sprouting broccoli in a pan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh in a bowl of cold water, then drain again. Heat a griddle pan, and toss the purple sprouting broccoli in a little olive oil, just enough to coat. Season and griddle for a few minutes, turning to cook on all sides. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with coriander leaves to serve, along with the griddled purple sprouting broccoli
