French beans with Parmesan
Introduction:
This is wonderful, simple veggie fast food. Try as a side with quick grilled salmon or chicken. We've used Parmesan in this recipe but if you are vegetarian you can use an alternative, or just enjoy your beans with butter. 
Ingredients:
300-400g French beans, topped & tailed 2 tbsp butter 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the French beans in boiling water until just tender but still squeaky. Melt the butter in another pan. Add the drained beans to the butter, raise the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan. Season and serve.
