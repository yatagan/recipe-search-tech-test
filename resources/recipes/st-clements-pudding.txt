St Clement's pudding
Introduction:
This dessert manages to be at once rich-tasting and light, with a well-judged balance of sweetness and tartness. A version of this was traditionally eaten on 23 November, the feast day of St. Clement, patron saint of blacksmiths. 
Ingredients:
75g butter or margarine 130g caster sugar 1 orange 2 lemons 2 eggs, separated 75g self-raising flour 300ml milk
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Lightly grease a deep ovenproof dish. Beat the butter in a bowl with the sugar and grated rinds of 1 lemon and the orange until pale and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and flour to the mixture and beat well. Pour in the milk and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of strained orange juice. Stir these ingredients together. Whisk the egg whites until they hold soft peaks. Fold into the mixture, with a large spoon and pour into the ovenproof dish. Stand the dish in a roasting tin with enough water to reach halfway up the side of the dish. Cook for about 40 minutes or until spongy to the touch.
