Rhubarb butter sauce for fish
Introduction:
Try serving this with salmon cooked by placing it on a head of elderflower in a baking parchment parcel with a dash of white wine, then baking in a hot oven so the bag puffs up and the salmon steams inside. It's also good with other oily fish and with pork. 
Ingredients:
500g rhubarb, cut into batons 2 tsp sugar grated zest & juice of 1 orange 150ml fish stock 40g chilled butter, cut into small pieces
Method:
Put the rhubarb, sugar, orange juice and zest in a pan and cook gently for about 15 minutes, until the rhubarb has broken down into a pur√©e. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, boil the fish stock until reduced by half its volume. Stir in the rhubarb, season and cook for 5 minutes, then push through a sieve into a clean pan. Just before serving, heat the sauce and whisk in the pieces of butter a few at a time to give a glossy finish. Season to taste.
