Chocolate Pavlova with raspberries
Introduction:
One of the most popular desserts in the Field Kitchen, this is well worth the effort involved. It will serve about 12 people, so make it for a crowd. If the berries are very tart, mix them with a little icing sugar. 
Ingredients:
for the meringue: 5 egg whites 300g caster sugar 3 drops of vanilla extract 1 tsp wine vinegar 1 tsp cornflour 2 tsp cocoa powder for the topping: 450g dark chocolate 250ml double cream 250ml crème fraîche 200g raspberries 1 tsp icing sugar 300ml double cream
Method:
First make the meringue: With an electric beater, whisk the egg whites until just stiff, then gradually add the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, whisking after each addition until stiff peaks are formed. Fold in the rest of the ingredients until the cocoa is mixed through the egg white. Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas ½. Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment. Shape the meringue into 2 circles on the parchment, each about 25cm in diameter and 2cm deep. Place in the oven and leave for 1½ hours, until the meringue is firm to the touch. Turn the oven off and leave the meringue in it for 30 minutes. Make the topping: Using a heavy knife, cut the dark chocolate into very small pieces and place in a bowl. Heat the cream to boiling point and pour it over the chocolate. Stir together, being careful not to over mix or the mixture will split. If the chocolate doesn’t combine with the cream and there are still a few lumps, place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir carefully until smooth. When the chocolate mix is ready, spread it over the 2 meringue discs and chill until set. Whip the crème fraîche and cream together until they are just thick enough to hold their shape. Spread them over the chocolate meringue discs. Put the raspberries in a bowl, sift in the icing sugar and toss well. Arrange them over the 2 discs and place one on top of the other for a magnificent dessert.
