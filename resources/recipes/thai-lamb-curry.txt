Thai massaman lamb curry
Introduction:
This is a rich, relatively mild curry that's slow-cooked to tenderness. Serve it scooped over boiled or steamed white rice and topped with a handful of toasted peanuts or cashews. This can also be made with diced beef. 
Ingredients:
500g lamb shoulder, diced 500g new potatoes, halved 2 tbsp orange massaman curry paste 5cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 400ml tin coconut milk 1 tsp sugar (ideally palm sugar) zest & juice of 1 lime 1 tbsp fish sauce 1 bunch coriander leaves 1 handful cashew or peanuts, toasted, to finish
Method:
Brown the meat in a frying pan and transfer to a saucepan, along with the potatoes. Add the massaman paste and ginger to the frying pan, fry for a few minutes until fragrant, tip in the coconut milk and bring to the boil. Season with the sugar, lime zest and fish sauce, then pour the sauce over the meat and potatoes. Cover and cook on a very low heat for a couple of hours until very tender. Spoon off any excess fat and add the lime juice. The curry should have a good balance of hot, sweet and sour flavours. Scatter with the coriander leaves and peanuts or cashews and serve with steamed rice.
