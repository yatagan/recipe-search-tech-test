Roasted green beans with za'atar
Introduction:
Za’atar is a Middle Eastern dried spice blend. This recipe makes more than you need for this recipe – keep the rest in an airtight container and use to sprinkle over hummus, fried eggs, roasted veg, chicken or salads. It will also keep well in an airtight container. If you can't get hold of zesty sumac, use a little lemon zest, but don’t add this in with the za’atar mix or it will make it soft; sprinkle it over the beans separately. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tsp sumac 1 tbsp dried marjoram 1 tbsp dried thyme 1 tbsp dried oregano 1 tsp sea salt 400g green beans, topped & tailed olive oil
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Gently heat the sesame seeds in a frying pan until golden and toasted. Remove from the heat. Put half of them in a pestle and mortar and pound together with the sumac, marjoram, thyme, oregano and slat. Add the rest of the sesame seeds. Put the beans in a baking dish and toss in just enough oil to coat. Roast in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until just tender but with some bite. Sprinkle over a little of the za'atar to serve.
