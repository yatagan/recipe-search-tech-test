Chilli and thyme green banana chips
Introduction:
During a trip to our banana growers in the Dominican Republic, we found that unripe bananas are commonly used in everyday cooking, and became increasingly addicted to this crunchy, moreish snack. It can be made either with green bananas or plantains and is perfect with a cold beer. Don’t even bother trying to peel green bananas from top to bottom. Instead, remove each end and score down one side. Prise the skin open and work it away from the flesh all the way around. The skin can be sticky and sappy, so it’s best to wear gloves if you can; avoid getting any on your clothes as the juices can stain. 
Ingredients:
5 green bananas, approx. 800g ½ tsp dried chilli flakes ½ tbsp freshly chopped thyme leaves oil for deep frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
First, peel the bananas (being careful not to stain your clothes with the skin juices as mentioned above). Peeling them will be more difficult than with yellow bananas, so you may need a knife to get into each one. Cut each banana in half and then into long batons, about 5mm thick. Heat a deep fat fryer to 180˚C and cook the chips for 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and toss in the chilli and thyme, along with some salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
