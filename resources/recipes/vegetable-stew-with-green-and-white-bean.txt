Vegetable stew with green and white beans
Introduction:
Made in advanced and re-heated, this is great for a weeknight dinner. The combination of the beans and lettuce give an outstanding flavour and texture. Substitute oil for butter and this also makes a lovely vegan recipe. 
Ingredients:
2 Little Gem lettuces 100g butter 225g French or runner beans, trimmed 2 carrots, peeled & cubed 200g white beans, shelled (can use tinned or dried) 2 turnips, peeled & cubed 3 potatoes, peeled & cubed 200g peas (frozen if fresh not available) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Wash the Little Gems (whole) and either quarter or halve. Use half the butter to grease a flameproof casserole dish. Add half of the lettuces and half of the other vegetables. Dot the surface with half of the remaining butter and fill the casserole with the remaining vegetables, combining them well. Dot the top with the rest of the butter and add 3 tablespoons of water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook over a moderate heat for 10-12 minutes, then bake in the oven for 40 minutes. Serve very hot.
