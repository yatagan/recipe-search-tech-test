Parsnip skordalia
Introduction:
Skordalia is a Greek side dish of potatoes and garlic whipped into a dip, thicken with stale bread or nuts and spiked with lemon juice. We make a version using parsnips, they are much more stable when blended and are less likely to go gluey than potatoes. 
Ingredients:
500g parsnips, peeled & chopped 1 bay leaf 1 garlic clove, finely chopped or crushed 200ml milk 40g flaked almonds, lightly toasted 30g fresh breadcrumbs 1 lemon 40ml olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Put the parsnips in a pan with the bay leaf and cover with the milk. Bring gently to the boil and simmer until very soft, about 15-20 minutes. Strain the parsnips and reserve the milk. Put the parsnips in a food processor with a dash of the milk and blend until smooth. Add the breadcrumbs, almonds and half the garlic and blend while adding the olive oil in a steady stream until it comes together. Add the juice of at least half the lemon and a good pinch of salt. Now check your seasoning.
