Pork, pasta, potato and spinach soup
Introduction:
The term ‘cucina rustica’ seems to be out of fashion but it should be reinstated for this. If you’re feeling like a walk on the wild side, it works equally well with sausages instead of the minced pork.
Ingredients:
for the meat mix: 500g minced pork pinch chilli flakes 1 garlic clove, finely chopped ½ tsp fennel seeds, crushed 70ml glass wine, red or white for the soup: olive oil 1 red onion, diced 2 garlic cloves, chopped 100g pancetta or streaky bacon, diced 450g potatoes, peeled & cut into 1½cm cubes 2 celery stick, de-stringed & cut into 1½ cubes 100g Parmesan, grated, & a piece of rind 300g spelt penne 300g spinach salt & pepper
Method:
For the meat mixture, combine the ingredients well, compact as much as possible and leave for an hour. For the soup: Heat three tablespoons of oil into a large, heavy saucepan and gently cook the onion on a low heat until it becomes translucent. Add the garlic and pancetta, and turn up the heat a little. Stir until they start to fry and then add the potatoes, meat mix, celery and cheese rind. Keep stirring for about 5 minutes until the pork has browned and the potatoes have started cooking. Add the pasta and cover with boiling water. Stir the mixture frequently, and cook for about 9 minutes; you might need to add some more water. Add the spinach and cook for another 5 minutes, it should then be cooked – test the pasta to see. Season to taste and serve with more olive oil and the grated Parmesan. The rind should have melted into a mush, one lucky winner will find it in their serving.
