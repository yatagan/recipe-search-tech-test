Crispy Pan-fried Fish with Spinach & Tomato Risotto
Introduction:
Risotto requires a little love and attention. Feed with stock and stir frequently to produce plump rice with a creamy consistency. Fish fillets may vary in thickness, so you may need to adjust the cooking time if you have large fillets. For the ultimate crispy skin, it should be as dry as possible when it hits the pan; to help dry the skin, dab it with kitchen towel, if you have any.
Ingredients:
2 shallots, finely diced oil for frying e.g. sunflower 3 tomatoes, roughly chopped 6 sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp oregano 200g risotto rice 100ml white wine 2 tbsp tomato purée 700ml vegetable or fish stock 150g baby spinach 2 pollock fillets 1 lemon, zested & juiced Parmesan cheese, for grating
Method:
Add the shallots to a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of oil. Cook over a low heat for 3-4 minutes, until softened. Add the fresh and dried tomatoes, garlic, oregano and rice to the shallots. Stir over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes. Add the white wine. Cook out for a further 1-2 minutes to reduce the alcohol. Add the tomato purée and a ladle of stock to the risotto. Stir until the rice has absorbed the stock. Repeat with more ladles of stock at intervals, stirring until the rice is tender; 20-25 minutes. When ready, stir in the spinach until wilted. Leave to rest. Season the fish on both sides. Fry the fish, skin-side down, for 3-4 minutes, until the skin is crisp. Gently turn it over and cook for a further 2-3 minutes (see cook’s note). Finish with a dash of lemon juice. Taste the risotto and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Divide between 2 bowls and top with the fish. Serve with a sprinkle of lemon zest and plenty of grated Parmesan.
