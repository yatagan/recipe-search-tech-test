Celery with chestnuts
Introduction:
This vegetarian side has a nice, almost meaty bite, and a mellow, sweet flavour. Don't be tempted to settle for canned chestnuts â€“ they make poor substitute in this here. This is good with a roast dinner and pairs well with both poultry and Brussels sprouts. 
Ingredients:
15 chestnuts celery chicken, duck, beef or vegetable stock 1 small head bouquet garni 50g butter salt & pepper
Method:
With a sharp knife score a deep 'x' through the tough skin of each chestnut. Put them in a saucepan with enough water to cover generously. Bring to the boil and simmer for 2 minutes. One or two at a time, take the chestnuts out of the saucepan and peel off outer and inner skin. Discard any chestnuts that are discoloured. Rinse out the pan and return the chestnuts to it with enough fresh water or stock to cover. Simmer until tender, then drain and break into large pieces. Place the celery in a pan in just enough stock to cover add the bouquet garni and simmer until barely tender. Drain, and discard the bouquet garni. Rinse the saucepan and return the celery to it with the chestnuts, butter, salt and pepper. Stir over a moderate heat for a few minutes until chestnuts and celery are thoroughly heated through and impregnated with butter. Serve.
