Karahi lamb curry
Introduction:
The last minute addition of green chillies, coriander leaf and cumin gives this curry a zippy freshness you won’t get from your local curry house. Masala curry paste makes great English/Raj style curries, kedgeree and coconut based soups and can also be used in North African tagines. 
Ingredients:
500g onions, sliced 150g clarified butter 3 tbsp masala curry paste 1 tin chopped tomatoes 150ml water 500g diced lamb 1 tsp salt 1 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tbsp ground cumin 1 tbsp ground coriander 1 tbsp paprika 1 sweet potato, diced 1 tin chickpeas 4 medium green chillies 350g spinach, destalked, chopped & washed small bunch coriander leaves, chopped ½ tsp ground cumin, to garnish black pepper
Method:
Gently fry the onions in the clarified butter for at least 20 minutes until nice and brown. Remove with a slotted spoon. Keep the butter. Blitz the onions, masala curry paste, tomatoes and water into a smooth purée and return to the pan with the butter. Add the lamb and salt and simmer gently for half an hour. Stir in the cayenne, cumin, coriander and paprika and add the sweet potato and chickpeas. Continue to cook for another 30 minutes. Chop the green chillies and blitz with a little water and set aside (a stick blender works well here). Steam half of the spinach until it wilts and blitz to a purée. Stir in the puréed spinach along with the remaining spinach leaves and cook the curry for another 5 minutes. Add the puréed green chilli to taste and garnish with the chopped coriander, ground cumin and black pepper.
