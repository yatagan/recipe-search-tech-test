Swedish meatballs with dill and mustard sauce
Introduction:
Serve these with gravy and mash, or as part of a smorgasbord with dill and mustard sauce. 
Ingredients:
350g beef mince 1 egg, beaten 1 small onion, finely chopped or grated 75g fresh white breadcrumbs 1 tbsp dill, chopped, plus extra to serve ½ tsp allspice salt & pepper olive oil, for frying for the dill & mustard sauce: 2 tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 tbsp crème fraîche 1 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a bowl, mix the minced beef with the egg, onion, breadcrumbs, dill and seasoning. Form into small meatballs about the size of walnuts; you should get about 20. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan and cook the meatballs until evenly browned (10-15 minutes). Stir the mustard and vinegar together and add the oil a little at a time, whisking to make a smooth sauce. Stir in the crème fraîche, season and add the chopped dill.
