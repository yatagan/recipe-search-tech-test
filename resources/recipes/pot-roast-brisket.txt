Pot roast brisket
Introduction:
One to pop in the oven before heading off on a long Sunday walk. Brisket is a cheaper, open-grained cut of beef that's full of flavour and really suited to slow-cooking. This is lovely with caramelised shallots, cabbage and mash. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1.5kg piece brisket, rolled & tied with string 1 onion, finely chopped 2 carrots, peeled & diced 2 sticks of celery, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 300ml red wine 2 bay leaves 500g vine tomatoes, roughly chopped, or use 1 tin chopped tomatoes 1 sprig rosemary salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160˚C/Gas 3. In a large flameproof casserole dish, heat the oil and fry the meat on all sides until browned. Remove the meat from the pan and add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic. Fry gently for about 8-10 minutes, until softened. Add the meat and any juices back to the pan, along with the rest of the ingredients. Bring to the boil, transfer to the oven and cook for about 3 ½-4 hours until it is tender, turning the meat half way through. Remove from the oven, take the meat, bay leaves and rosemary sprig out of the casserole dish, then blitz the vegetables into a sauce. Check the seasoning and serve the meat in slices alongside the sauce.
