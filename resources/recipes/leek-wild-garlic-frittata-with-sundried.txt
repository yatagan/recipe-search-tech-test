Leek and wild garlic frittata, with sun-dried tomatoes and ricotta
Introduction:
Frittatas are the ultimate last-minute meal: this one takes under 20 minutes. It's light and punchy, good for vegetarians and you can customise it as much as you like. Almost any cooked veg can go in â€“ but if you leave out the leeks, include onions or lots of spring onions to give yourself a good base of flavour. Try with purple sprouting broccoli or Calabrese, or with fresh tomatoes instead of sun-dried. Like many egg-based dishes (quiches, tarts etc.) this is best eaten warm or at room temperature rather than piping hot. 
Ingredients:
30g butter 250g (2 small to medium) leeks, finely sliced, use green parts too 6 wild garlic leaves, finely shredded 6 sundried tomatoes, finely chopped 4 eggs, beaten 125g ricotta salt & pepper
Method:
Melt the butter in a small to medium frying pan. Add the leeks and gently cook for 8-10 minutes, until soft. Add the wild garlic leaves and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes. Mix the beaten egg with the ricotta in a small jug or bowl and season well. Pour into the leek mixture and roll around the pan until it is evenly distributed. Cook on the hob for 2-3 minutes, until the base has just set, then finish under the grill or in the oven until just set.
