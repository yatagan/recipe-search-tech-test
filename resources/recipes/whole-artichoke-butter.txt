Whole artichoke & butter
Introduction:
A raw globe artichoke is an intimidating foe for most people. It is well armoured and much cutting, trimming and scrapping is need to claim the prized flesh. I’ve opted for the easy and continental route, namely boiled whole and dismantled when warm. The trick is to pull away the leaves one by one, dip in the butter and scrape and suck the nugget of tender flesh from each leaf as you go. When you reach the centre remove the furry inedible choke with a teaspoon before eating the tender heart. A meal, a challenge, an education. 
Ingredients:
2 large globe artichokes juice of 1 lemon 1 bay leaf 50g butter
Method:
Bring a large pan of salted water up to the boil. Cut off the top ¼ of the artichokes, use scissor to trim off the very tips of any visible leaves. Snap off the stalks. Add the lemon juice and bay to the water. Gently drop the artichoke into the water, return to the boil, loosely cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Put the butter in a small pan and gently melt. Check the artichokes, if one of the central leaves pull away with little resistance then they are done. Remove gently from the pan and leave to drain upside down in the colander for 5 minutes. To serve place each artichoke on a plate with a little ramekin of melted butter on the side.
