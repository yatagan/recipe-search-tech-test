Ginger and soy marinade
Introduction:
This tangy, sweet and sour soy-ginger marinade works well with pork chops, beef steaks, chicken and firm-fleshed fish. Marinate fish for 1-2 hours, and meat for a minimum of 3 hours or overnight. This goes well with an Asian coleslaw with peanuts and chilli. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp sherry or balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated 1 tsp light brown sugar 1 tsp soy sauce
Method:
Mix all ingredients in a shallow dish.
