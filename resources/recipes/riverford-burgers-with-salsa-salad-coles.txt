Burgers with salsa, salad and coleslaw
Introduction:
A great showcase for good beef: fried patties, on a tender, floury bun topped with piquant salsa, and with sides of crisp green salad and classic coleslaw. You can also make your own burger patties. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped 2 tomatoes, deseeded & diced 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped balsamic vinegar olive oil ½ cabbage, red or white 1 onion, finely sliced 2 carrots, peeled & grated mayonnaise ½ lettuce 4 beef burgers 4 burger buns small handful fresh herbs – parsley or coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Make the salsa – in a bowl combine the onion, tomato and chilli. Add a splash of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, just enough to mix the salsa together. Season and add the chopped fresh herbs if using. Make the coleslaw –in a food processor or by hand finely shred the cabbage. Add the onion and carrots. Mix in enough mayonnaise to coat and season well. Finely shred the lettuce and toss in a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Cook the burgers by grilling or frying in a little oil, until cooked through. Serve in the buns spread with a little mayonnaise, topped with the salsa, with the coleslaw and salad on the side.
