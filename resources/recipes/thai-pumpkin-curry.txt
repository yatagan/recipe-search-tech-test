Thai pumpkin curry
Introduction:
A vegan dish which stands alone as a midweek main course, or as a side dish that's good with meat or fish. Eat with heaps of jasmine rice. Bruise the lemongrass by bashing it with a rolling pin to release the aromatic flavour. If you don't fancy making the Thai curry paste, you can buy it ready made. 
Ingredients:
for the Thai curry paste: 1 small red or white onion, chopped 1 stalk lemongrass, minced 2 red chillies 3 garlic cloves 2cm piece fresh ginger, chopped 2 tbsp tomato ketchup 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 2 tbsp soy sauce (if not vegetarian use thai fish sauce) 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp chilli powder 2 tbsp lime juice 2 tbsp coconut milk for the curry: 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large onion, sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1-2cm piece fresh ginger, grated 3 tbsp Thai curry paste 1kg pumpkin or squash flesh, diced 350ml coconut milk 200ml veg stock zest of Â½ lime 2 lemongrass stalks, bruised handful fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
To make the curry paste, blitz all the ingredients except the coconut milk in a food processor for a minute or two to combine. Add the coconut milk and blitz again until you have a smooth paste (add a little more coconut milk or water to thin a little if necessary). For the curry: Heat the oil in a large pan or wok. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and fry for 4-5 minutes. Add the curry paste and pumpkin or squash. Fry gently for another 4-5 minutes. Add the coconut milk, stock, lime zest and lemongrass. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until pumpkin is tender, stirring every now and then. Season with to taste. Add the chopped coriander leaves, stir and serve with rice.
