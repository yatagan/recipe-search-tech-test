Warm steak salad with potatoes, tomatoes & rocket
Introduction:
Simple, tasty organic sirloin steak from our farm butchery, served with a warm potato and rocket salad, punctuated with the sharp sweetness of cherry tomatoes. If you have a small appetite, save one or two of the potatoes too and use them up in a lunch box salad.
Ingredients:
400g salad potatoes ½ bag rocket punnet cherry tomatoes 1 lemon 1 tsp wholegrain mustard olive oil 2 sirloin steaks oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or light olive 1 tsp dried tarragon salt & pepper
Method:
Scrub the potatoes clean (no need to peel) and chop into similar sized, large pieces (half’s or quarter’s). Put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Add a good pinch of salt. Bring the pan up to the boil and cook for about 12-15 minutes, until the potatoes are just tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Meanwhile, wash half the rocket. Cut as many of the cherry tomatoes as you’d like to use in half, crossways. Squeeze the juice from quarter of the lemon into a large bowl. Add the mustard and 3 tablespoons of good olive oil. Season with a little salt and pepper. Whisk together. Drain the potatoes once cooked. Leave them in the colander for 1 minute for excess water to evaporate, then toss them in the mustard dressing. Keep to one side. Rub the steaks with a little oil and season with salt and pepper. Heat a frying pan until very hot. Fry the steaks for 1 minute on each side. This will give you a medium-rare steak so cook for longer if you prefer them better done. Transfer the steaks to a plate to rest while you finish the salad. Add the cherry tomatoes and dried tarragon to the same frying pan. Stir-fry on a medium-high heat until the tomatoes are just starting to soften, about 2-3 minutes. Mix the potatoes and dressing with the tomatoes and rocket, either in the bowl or pan. The rocket will wilt slightly either way. Taste and add more lemon juice, oil or seasoning to taste. Serve the warm salad with the steak.
