Spring onion, pea and mint soup
Introduction:
Our spring onions were planted last October and have battled their way slowly through the winter. They will bridge the gap until their siblings in the polytunnels burst forth in late May. Expect to see them in your box sometime over the next few weeks. Theyâ€™ll take up the allium baton as the leek season draws to a close. They can be used in place of leeks in many recipes but are mild enough to be used raw in salads too. This spring soup can be served hot or chilled.
Ingredients:
1 bunch spring onions 1 garlic clove 1 bay leaf 200g potatoes, peeled & diced 200g frozen peas 500ml chicken or veg stock 8 mints leaves, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Clean, trim & slice the onions, peel and slice the garlic. Fry them gently in a little oil and butter for 5 minutes until softening. Add the potatoes and stock, bring to simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft. Add the peas and mint. Remove the bay and blend till smooth. Season well with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice.
