The best Christmas pudding 
Introduction:
This tastes best if you make it a couple of weeks before Christmas and let it mature. Eat it with brandy butter or clotted cream. If you have any left over, gently fry slices of it, adding a little orange juice for moisture for the ultimate post-festivity breakfast. 
Ingredients:
75g self raising flour 75g breadcrumbs ½ tsp nutmeg, cinnamon & mixed spice 350g mixed dried fruit 125g brown sugar 1 carrot, grated 1 apple, grated 1 tbsp marmalade 50g suet 50g melted margarine 1 tbsp golden syrup lemon rind, grated 1 egg 1 tbsp lemon juice, milk & brandy
Method:
Mix everything together and stand overnight. More brandy can be added if you like. This can be cooked as individual puds in dariole moulds or teacups or as a single pud in a 1 kilo pudding basin. The steaming time will depend on the size of the pudding, but as a guide this one can be steamed for 2-3 hours to start with. Alternatively it can be “nuked” in a microwave. Cook on high for 5 minutes, leave to stand for 5 minutes repeating the process and then finally cooking for 4 minutes. Allow to cool and store until Christmas. Steam for 2 hours before serving. Flame with brandy and serve.
