Kohlrabi, apple and walnut salad
Introduction:
Our kohlrabi season starts in May. Kohlrabi has a radish-like crunch and a turnipy mildness that's easily enjoyed – as in this salad of mild, nutty kohlrabi, sweet apple, crunch toasted walnuts and crisp watercress. This is a lovely light and healthy lunch, or try it as a side to pork chops or salmon fillets. 
Ingredients:
3 kohlrabi, peeled & cut into small segments 2 crisp, red-skinned apples, cored & diced 2 Little Gem lettuces, shredded a little lemon juice a handful of watercress (optional) 75g walnuts, lightly toasted & broken into pieces 1 tbsp lemon juice ½ tsp sugar ½ tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp light olive oil 2 tbsp walnut oil pinch celery salt salt & pepper
Method:
Combine the kohlrabi, apples and little gem lettuces in a serving bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent browning. Add the watercress, if using, and the toasted walnuts. Whisk together all the remaining ingredients. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss well.
