Strozzapreti
Introduction:
A good way of turning a large bunch of greens into a very special dinner. These melting cheese and green balls – somewhere in between gnocchi and dumplings – are best eaten with a mound of pasta. Substitute the Parmesan for another hard cheese to keep them vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
500g chard or spinach, stalks removed 375g ricotta cheese 3-4 eggs 125g Parmesan cheese ½ tsp nutmeg 50g plain white flour, sifted finely 25g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Boil or steam chard leaves for 3-5 minutes or until tender. Drain and cool, squeeze until most of the water has been removed. Chop chard very finely. Place the chard in a bowl, add the ricotta, and mix thoroughly using your hands. Add one egg and mix, then add half the Parmesan cheese and mix again. Add two more eggs, mix again and add the seasoning and the nutmeg. If the texture is thick enough, do not add any more eggs, if not add some flour to hold mixture together. Roll mixture with your hands to make a ball (slightly larger than gnocchi), sprinkle with flour, repeat procedure until mixture is gone. Place the strozzapetti on a floured surface and leave them to rest for an hour. Boil a large saucepan of salted water, add the strozzapetti and boil for 2 minutes Gently scoop them out and keep them warm. Melt butter, pour over strozzapreti and sprinkle over remaining cheese. Serve with pasta and a tomato sauce.
