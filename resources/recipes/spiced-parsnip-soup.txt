Spiced parsnip soup
Introduction:
Many parsnip soup recipes include curry flavours, understandably, as parsnips work well with Indian spicing. The addition of coconut milk here gives a subtler flavour, resulting in a delicious, warming soup. This is good as a starter or light lunch with crusty bread. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp butter 1 tbsp sunflower oil 1 onion, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2cm fresh ginger, finely chopped 1 chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground turmeric 2 cardamom pods 1 carrot, finely chopped 1 celery stalk, finely chopped 1 leek (white part only), finely chopped 4-5 parsnips, peeled & roughly chopped 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped 400ml coconut milk 600ml hot vegetable stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the butter and oil in a large pan, add the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until softened. Stir in the spices and cook for 1 minute. Add the carrot, celery and leek, reduce the heat and cook for 5 minutes. Finally add the parsnip chunks and half the chopped coriander. Mix thoroughly and cook for 2 minutes, then pour in the coconut milk and hot stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, cover and cook for 15–20 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Cool slightly and blitz in a food processor or with a handheld blender. Reheat gently, season to taste and sprinkle with the rest of the chopped coriander.
