Kale, pecan and cranberry pilaf
Introduction:
This is a lovely, healthy dish of brown rice and kale contrasted with crunchy pecans and sweet cranberries. Walnuts work if you haven't got any pecans, and you can use any variety of kale that you have in your box. Be sure to strip the tougher stalks from the leaves, as these can taste bitter. Pomegranate molasses have a distinctive sweet and sour taste. They’re worth seeking out, but otherwise finish the dish with a splash of balsamic or sherry vinegar and a glug of good olive oil. 
Ingredients:
150g pecan nuts, roughly chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 1 red onion, finely chopped 300g short grain brown rice, rinsed & drained 100ml dry sherry (or use dry white wine) 550ml hot veg stock a few rosemary leaves, finely chopped 200g red Russian kale, roughly chopped 100g dried cranberries 1-1½ tbsp pomegranate molasses (add gradually to taste) salt & pepper
Method:
In a large heavy based pan, gently toast the pecan nuts for a couple of minutes, until you can start to smell their aroma. Remove from the pan and set to one side. Heat the oil in the same pan. Add the onion and fry on a low heat for 7-8 minutes, until softened. Add the rice, stir for a minute, then add the sherry, followed by 500ml of the stock and the rosemary. Season, cover and simmer on the lowest heat for 40-50 minutes, or until the rice is just cooked through. Add a tablespoon or so more stock if the rice starts to catch on the bottom of the pan. Add the kale and cook for another 3-4 minutes, uncovered, or until the kale has wilted. Add the dried cranberries, pecans and 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses, stir gently to combine. Check seasoning, add more molasses to taste and serve.
