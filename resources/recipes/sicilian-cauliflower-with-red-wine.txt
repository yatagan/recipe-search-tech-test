Sicilian cauliflower with red wine
Introduction:
This cauliflower recipe packs a big punch. It's good eaten at room temperature as well as warm. It makes a lovely starter, served just with croutons; or a light vegetarian dinner with rice or pasta; or substantial side to strong-tasting dishes like steak. Your could also add in a few anchovies, raisins, pine nuts or capers. 
Ingredients:
1-2 slices white bread, crusts removed olive oil 90ml red wine 50ml olive oil 3-4 sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped 1 cauliflower, broken or cut into small florets 1 garlic clove, minced ½ onion, finely chopped ½ tsp red chilli, finely chopped handful pitted black olives, sliced 50g Provolone cheese, grated handful flat leaf parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
To make the croutons, cut bread into little squares, roughly ½cm across. Heat some oil in a frying pan and fry until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper and reserve. Pour half the wine and half the olive oil into a large heavy based pan, stir in the sundried tomatoes and arrange half the cauliflower over. Scatter with half the garlic, onion, chilli, olives and Provolone. Repeat these layers with remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil, cover the saucepan with a well fitting lid and sweat for 10-15 minutes over a lowish heat, stirring once. Once cauliflower is tender, add salt and pepper, stir in parsley and serve with croutons scattered over the top.
