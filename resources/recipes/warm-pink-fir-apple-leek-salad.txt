Warm pink fir apple and leek salad with Wootton White cheese
Introduction:
Knobbly pink fir apples have a butter yellow, waxy flesh, and a distinctive nutty flavour. Their taste can be fully appreciated here simply boiled and tossed with leeks and cheese. Our crumbly, tangy sheep’s cheese from Wootton Dairy lends a good contrast, but feta would also work a treat. Serve this on its own as a light main, or a side to chicken or fish. 
Ingredients:
800g pink fir apple potatoes, scrubbed, skins on, chopped into 2-3 chunks 1 leek, halved lengthways, very finely shredded (or use 1 large onion) 1 pack Wootton White cheese or feta for the dressing: 1 tbsp cider or white wine vinegar 1 heaped tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp capers or gherkins, chopped (if the capers come in brine, soak them in water for 20 mins, then drain) 2 tbsp fresh herbs, chopped – we use tarragon but you could also try chervil, parsley or dill, or a mixture 3 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the potatoes in a pan of salted water for about 12 minutes, until tender. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pan or frying pan. Fry the leeks very gently and slowly for the time it takes to cook the potatoes, stirring now and then. Add a splash of water if they look like they are catching and burning. For the dressing combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Add the warm leeks and drained potatoes. Season to taste and serve with the Wootton White cheese crumbled over the top.
