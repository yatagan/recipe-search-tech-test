Shredded Brussels sprouts salad
Introduction:
Raw, shaved sprouts have a lovely crunch and flavour which is particularly welcome in the winter months. Use the smallest, freshest sprouts you can find for this salad. If you're vegetarian, exchange the ham for goat's cheese. 
Ingredients:
50g whole hazelnuts in their skins 3 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp Dijon mustard lemon juice to taste 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped a few slices air-dried ham or bresaola 200g Brussels sprouts, trimmed & very finely shredded 50g Parmesan or Pecorino, shaved salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4 and roast the hazelnuts for 10 minutes, then take them out of the oven. Rub them in a clean tea towel to remove the skins, then roughly chop them. Whisk the oil, mustard and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the parsley. Arrange the ham and Brussels sprouts on a serving plate and scatter over the hazelnuts. Drizzle over the dressing and scatter over the cheese.
