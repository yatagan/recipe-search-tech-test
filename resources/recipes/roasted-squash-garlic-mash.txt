Roasted squash and garlic mash with crispy fried onions
Introduction:
A firmer, less watery fleshed squash works best here, eg. butternut or crown prince. If you don’t have a deep fat fryer, you could fry the onions in a deep pan approx 1 quarter full with oil, but take care, use a thermometer to monitor the temperature and keep a close eye on them. 
Ingredients:
1 whole garlic bulb olive oil 1 large squash about 1.5kg, cut in half lengthways olive oil sunflower oil for frying 2 large onions, very finely sliced salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Cut a small slice off the top of the garlic bulb, enough to reveal the cloves inside. Place the bulb cut side up on a piece of foil, drizzle with olive oil and season. Wrap the foil around the garlic to seal it. Place in a roasting tin and pop in the oven for 15 minutes. Rub the cut side of the squash with a little olive oil, season and, after 15 minutes, place cut side down in the roasting tin with the garlic. Bake both for another 45 minutes, until the squash is tender. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 180°C/Gas 4. Add the onions and fry for a few minutes until golden brown. Depending on the capacity of your fryer, you may need to cook in batches. Drain on kitchen paper. When tender, remove the squash and garlic from the oven. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the soft roasted garlic out of the bulb. Scoop the squash flesh out of the skins and lightly mash, stirring in enough roasted garlic purée and seasoning to your taste. Keep any leftover garlic in the fridge (it’s great spread on toast before grilling with cheese). You may need to gently reheat the mash, then serve sprinkled with the crispy onions.
