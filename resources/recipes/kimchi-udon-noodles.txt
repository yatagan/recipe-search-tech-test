Kimchi udon noodles
Introduction:
‘Kimchi’ is a Korean staple side dish, traditionally made by adding spices such as chilli and garlic to salted cabbage and allowing it to ferment. Its spicy and salty flavour is enhanced when fried, as it starts to caramelise. Adding noodles and stir-fried veg makes this a complete meal with a range of textures and flavours.
Ingredients:
80g kimchi ¼ tsp chilli flakes - add to taste 2 tbsp tamari 1 tsp light brown sugar 150g udon noodles 2 garlic cloves, peeled & finely chopped 2 medium carrots, peeled into ribbons 125g spring onions, thinly sliced, tops kept to one side 200g pak choi, thinly shredded 1 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp sesame oil
Method:
Put the kimchi in a sieve over a small bowl. Using the back of a spoon, press out as much liquid from the kimchi as you can. Save the liquid and roughly chop the kimchi. Put the chilli flakes in a mug with a splash of the tamari (approx. ½ tbsp) and a pinch of the sugar. Fill a medium pan with boiled water and add a pinch of salt. Boil the noodles for 6-7 mins until just tender. Drain and run under cold water. Dry fry the sesame seeds in a frying pan for 2-3 mins, until lightly golden. Transfer to a plate. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in the frying pan. On a medium-high heat, stir fry the garlic for approx. 30 secs - be careful not to burn it. Add the kimchi. Stir-fry for approx. 2 mins, until it starts to caramelise and smell fragrant. Add a little more oil, the white parts of the onions and the pak choi. Stir fry for 2 mins. Add the carrot and stir-fry for a further 1 min. Stir in the noodles, the kimchi liquid and a splash of sesame oil. Add as much of the chilli flakes as you’d like. Thoroughly mix everything together on the heat for 1 min, to warm the noodles. Add more tamari to taste and check the seasoning. Serve, topped with sesame seeds, the green spring onion tops and extra sesame oil if you like.
