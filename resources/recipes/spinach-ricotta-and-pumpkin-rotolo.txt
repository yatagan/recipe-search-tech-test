Spinach, ricotta and pumpkin rotolo
Introduction:
This unusual Italian poached pasta dish is slightly fiddly to make but entirely delicious and a very good vegetarian dinner party piece. You can make it in advance and cook it when you're ready. Rotolo just means to 'coil' or 'scroll'. 
Ingredients:
for the pasta: 350g pasta flour pinch salt 2 whole eggs 5 egg yolks for the filling: 300g pumpkin or squash, cut into 1cm dice olive oil 25g butter ½ garlic clove, crushed 300g spinach, washed, blanched & roughly chopped 350g crumbly ricotta cheese 60g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. To make the pasta: Mix the ingredients together in a food processor. Knead on a flat surface until the mixture is smooth.Cut into 4, wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. To make the filling: Roast the pumpkin dice in olive oil, salt and pepper in the oven until cooked but not coloured. Melt the butter in a pan, add the garlic and the spinach and braise for a few minutes. Season well and leave to cool. Put the ricotta in a large bowl and break up with a fork. Add the spinach and mix thoroughly, folding through the pumpkin. Check the seasoning and sprinkle with Parmesan. Roll out the pasta onto a sheet as thinly as possible. Using a pasta machine, you can get 2 strips joined together to make a square. Lay them on a clean tea towel. Cover two thirds of the pasta with the spinach and pumpkin mix to a thickness of 1cm. Gently roll the pasta up into a big sausage and wrap with the tea towel. Secure with string to hold the shape. Cook in boiling water in a fish kettle for about 20 minutes. Unwrap and cut into 1cm slices. Serve with extra Parmesan and sage butter. Serve with creamy mashed potatoes and some winter veg.
