Porchetta leftovers and warm lentil salad
Introduction:
A gorgeous meal-in-one warm lentil salad with aromatic slow-cooked pork and fresh, crunchy vegetables. When making porchetta, always make enough for more than one meal – the leftovers are wonderfully versatile. Vary the veg if you've got others to hand – try roasted beets, carrots and parsnips, or slivers of raw fennel. 
Ingredients:
100g Puy lentils 2 garlic cloves, crushed 300ml vegetable bouillon leftover porchetta, shredded 150g French beans, blanched 150g cherry tomatoes, halved 150g young spinach leaves olive oil balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Place a tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan and gently cook the shallot and garlic for a few minutes to soften without colouring. Add the lentils and vegetable bouillon and bring to the boil. Skim away any scum rising to the surface. Lower the heat and cook as per the packet instructions until the lentils are tender but not falling apart. Drain the lentils and remove the garlic. While the lentils are cooking, bring a pan of water to the boil. Blanch the French beans for 3-4 minutes, drain and plunge into cold or ice water to halt the cooking. To serve the salad, lay the spinach leaves over the base of 4 plates. Toss the beans, tomatoes and porchetta with the lentils to gently warm them. Season, then spoon on top of the spinach leaves, and top with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.
