Roasted veg and double cheese pancakes
Introduction:
For an extra herby kick, add two tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs (parsley and tarragon would be good), to the pancake batter before frying. For the veg, include any or all of aubergine, courgettes, peppers, squash, onion, sweet potato, mushrooms, beetroot. Or try using a mixture of root veg. Make this with our basic pancake mix. 
Ingredients:
500g mixed veg for roasting, peeled & roughly cut into similar sized pieces olive or rapeseed oil leaves from 2 sprigs of fresh thyme 2 garlic cloves, left whole 100g Cheddar, grated 100g double Gloucester, grated 4 pancakes salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200ËšC/Gas 6. Put all the veg in a baking dish and toss in just enough oil to coat, along with the thyme, garlic and seasoning. Bake in the oven until just tender, about 30-40 minutes. Place the pancakes in a baking dish and share the veg between them, covering one side of the pancake, then folding them over to cover the veg. Sprinkle over the cheeses and place under a medium grill until the cheese has melted, and serve immediately.
