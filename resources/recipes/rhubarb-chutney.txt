Rhubarb chutney
Introduction:
This simple-to-follow recipe makes a chutney that's good with cheese, pâté, cold and warm meat. If you prefer, you could replace half the rhubarb with apples. Makes approximately 2.5kg (5lbs). Keep tucked away for at least a month before eating, so that the tastes can develop.

2kg rhubarb, cleaned & diced 500g onions, minced or finely chopped 250g dates, stoned & chopped 1 litre vinegar 2 tbsp ground mixed spice 2 tsp ground ginger or curry powder 25g salt 1kg sugar
Method:
