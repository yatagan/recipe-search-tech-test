Rhubarb and ginger jam
Introduction:
This preserve is an easy way to extend your enjoyment of rhubarb outside it's season. It's great on toast, or for sandwiching together a light vanilla sponge. It will make about 1.4kg. 
Ingredients:
1kg trimmed rhubarb, chopped 1kg sugar juice of 2 small lemons 25g fresh ginger 100g crystallised ginger, chopped
Method:
Mix the chopped rhubarb, sugar and lemon juice in a large bowl and leave overnight. Bash the fresh ginger to break the root up a bit and tie in a muslin bag. Put the rhubarb mixture and the ginger muslin bag in a heavy pan and boil rapidly for 15 minutes. Remove the fresh ginger bag, add the preserved ginger and boil again until the rhubarb is clear. Test for a set by leaving a small amount of the jam mix on a cold plate. If it wrinkles when you push your finger through it then it's ready. Skim the surface of the jam with a slotted spoon then pot and seal in sterilised jars.
