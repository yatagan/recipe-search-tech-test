Red cabbage slaw
Introduction:
Red cabbage's dramatic colour and fresh taste is welcome alongside winter's earthy roots. This crisp slaw goes well with many dishes – with grilled or roast chicken or richer meat such as venison for dinner; with a bowl of soup for an easy lunch; as a texture-giving sandwich filler. These quantities are a rough guide only. Add some Dijon or wholegrain mustard if you want it to have more of a kick, or a squeeze or lemon juice or vinegar for some sharpness.You could also add grated apple and some toasted, chopped walnuts or hazelnuts.
