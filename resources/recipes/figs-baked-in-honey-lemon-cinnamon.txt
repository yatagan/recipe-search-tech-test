Figs baked in honey, lemon and cinnamon 
Introduction:
Figs are new to Riverford and totally moreish. They’re great cut into wedges and added to salads, or stuffed with ricotta and wrapped in an air-dried ham before roasting until soft and the ham crispy. Or try this baked version. Great on its own for breakfast with a dollop of thick yoghurt and granola too if you like, or serve as a light pudding with yoghurt or mascarpone. Depending on how many figs you want to eat, it will serve 2-3, but will easily scale up to feed a crowd for an easy dinner party dessert. 
Ingredients:
6 figs 25g butter 2 tbsp clear honey 1 tbsp lemon juice 2 good pinches ground cinnamon thick Greek yoghurt & granola (optional for breakfast), to serve
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas 5. Cut a cross in the figs, about ⅔ of the way through, keeping the base intact. Grease a small baking dish or ovenproof pan with a little of the butter. Lay the figs in the pan. Try to keep them as upright as you can. Pop the rest of the butter in a separate small saucepan, with the honey, lemon juice and cinnamon. Heat gently to warm the honey and melt the butter, then pour it over the figs Bake for about 10-15 minutes, until the figs have just softened.
