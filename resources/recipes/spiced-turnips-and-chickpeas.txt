Spiced turnips and chickpeas
Introduction:
This cheap and warming vegetarian dish is substantial enough to work as a main course. If you'd like to make a vegan version, omit the honey and use brown sugar instead. There's no need to be too exact about the quantities and any other root veggies can be thrown in. 
Ingredients:
175g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight 750g medium-sized turnips, peeled & cut into 1cm cubes 25g unsalted butter 1 tbsp sunflower oil 1 onion, coarsely grated 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cumin Â½ tbsp ground coriander 1 tbsp honey 2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Drain the chickpeas and cook in unsalted water until almost but not quite tender. Drain, reserving the cooking water. Blanch the turnips for 2 minutes in boiling water, then drain. Melt the butter and oil in a wide saucepan and add the chickpeas, onion, turnips, spices and enough of the water from cooking the chickpeas to just cover. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover and stir in the honey, half the chopped coriander, salt and plenty of pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for a further 10-15 minutes until the liquid is reduced to a thick sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining coriander and serve.
