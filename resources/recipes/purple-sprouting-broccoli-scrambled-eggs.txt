Purple sprouting broccoli and scrambled eggs
Introduction:
This quick and easy vegetarian recipe works with asparagus as well as purple sprouting broccoli. Eat with a buttery slice of rye or sourdough toast to mop up the last of the scrambled eggs. 
Ingredients:
1 head purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed & cut into florets 40g butter & another knob of butter 4 eggs, beaten, 1 tbsp milk or cream squeeze lemon juice 2 slices bacon, pancetta or smoked salmon (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the broccoli in boiling salted water until just tender, drain and keep warm on a plate. While the broccoli is cooking, melt the 40g butter in a small heavy saucepan or small frying pan, then turn down the heat as low as possible and add the eggs, milk or cream and seasoning Cook gently, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon. When the eggs have begun to thicken (this will take a few minutes) watch carefully and remove from the heat just before they are done â€“ they should be loose and creamy. Melt the remaining butter, add a squeeze of lemon, and pour over the broccoli. Pour the eggs beside the broccoli, grind over some more pepper, and serve.
