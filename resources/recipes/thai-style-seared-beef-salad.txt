Introduction:
If hot or cold roast beef isn’t for you, try slicing the joint into steaks and making this dish, it’s easy to make and perfect for a hot summer’s evening. 
Ingredients:
500g lean beef joint, sliced into 1cm steaks for the dressing: 3 limes, juiced 1 lime, zested 1 piece lemongrass, outer skin removed, finely chopped 1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 1 red or green chilli, finely chopped 2 tbsp fish sauce 2 tbsp mint leaves, roughly chopped for the salad: ½ head Chinese leaves 12 cherry tomatoes, quartered 1 cucumber, peeled, deseeded & cut into thick batons 6 spring onions, sliced lengthways 1 heaped tbsp coriander, roughly chopped 1 heaped tbsp basil leaves, roughly chopped
Method:
Season the beef and brush with sunflower oil. Heat up a heavy griddle pan to smoking hot and quickly sear the steaks for about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a bowl, cover with foil and leave to cool. Make the dressing by mixing all the ingredients together. Taste; it should have a distinct sweet and sour flavour. You might want to add a little sugar (ideally palm) or more sweet chilli sauce. Slice the cooked steak into thin ribbons and add to the dressing, stirring around to get a good coating. Add any meat juices. Make the salad: Finely shred the Chinese leaves and mix with the other salad ingredients. Mix everything together and serve with lime quarters.
