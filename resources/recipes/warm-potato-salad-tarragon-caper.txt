Warm potato salad with tarragon and caper dressing
Introduction:
Tarragon is often overlooked in favour of mint, basil or coriander, but it's flavour, somewhere between vanilla and anise, adds a piquant complexity to this hearty summer potato salad. Eat this as an accompaniment at picnics or barbecues, or as a side to grilled mackerel or trout. 
Ingredients:
800g salad potatoes, scrubbed, cleaned & cut in half 1 tbsp sherry vinegar 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp capers, soaked in a bowl of water for 10 mins, then drained & roughly chopped 1 tbsp fresh tarragon leaves, chopped 5 tbsp olive oil 100g sheepâ€™s milk cheese, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan of salted boiling water, cook the potatoes until just tender, about 10-12 minutes. Drain. Whisk all of the remaining ingredients, apart from the cheese, together in a bowl. Season well. Add the potatoes while still warm and toss together to coat in the dressing. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle over the cheese.
