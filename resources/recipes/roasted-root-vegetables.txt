Roasted root vegetables
Introduction:
We serve this at the Field Kitchen in various guises throughout the autumn and winter, depending on what's available. Roasting root vegetables caramelises them slightly and intensifies their natural flavours. We occasionally drizzle them with a little honey before cooking and then finish the dish off with a splash of balsamic vinegar. Served with couscous, this is a healthy vegetarian main, or it could be eaten alongside a roast chicken as a more interesting alternative to plain roast potatoes. 
Ingredients:
about 1kg mixed vegetables - choose from: baking potatoes, beetroot, carrots, celeriac, Jerusalem artichokes, squash, parsnips, red onions or shallots, kohlrabi, turnip or swede 4 garlic cloves olive oil for drizzling 1 tsp thyme leaves or chopped rosemary salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Peel the vegetables and cut them into 3cm chunks; if you are using beetroot and carrot, cut them slightly smaller, as they take longer to cook. If using onions, simply cut them into quarters, leaving the root on to hold them together. Leave shallots whole. Parboil the potatoes for 2 minutes, then drain. Put all the vegetables in a roasting tray in a single layer, add the garlic and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with the thyme and/or chopped rosemary and season. Place in an oven and roast for about 1 hour, turning halfway through, until all the vegetables are tender and browned.
