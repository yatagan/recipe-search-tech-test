Gujerati cabbage and carrot
Introduction:
This traditional Gujerati side goes well with any Indian curry meal. If you can't find black mustard seeds, brown ones are fine. Any type of cabbage will work but crinkly Savoy is best here. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil 1 tbsp black mustard seeds 1 dried chilli ½ cabbage, thinly sliced 2 carrots, coarsely grated 1 tbsp caster sugar juice of ½ lemon
Method:
Heat the oil in a wok and add the mustard seeds and chilli. When the seeds start to pop, add the cabbage and carrots and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add all the sugar and lemon and cook for a minute longer. Serve immediately.
