Cream of potato and turnip soup
Introduction:
Turnips have a mild taste and silkiness that's ideal for soups. This is good either left in rustic chunks or liquidised. It's best served with crusty bread and some olive oil. A couple of leeks would make a good addition to this if you had them in your veg box. 
Ingredients:
100g onions 200g turnips 200g potatoes 50g butter 50g plain flour 1 litre stock sprig rosemary 60ml cream salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the onions and dice the turnips and potatoes into 5mm cubes. Gently cook for 2 minutes in the butter in a large saucepan. Mix in the flour and cook gently for another 2 minutes. Heat the stock in a separate pan until it is just beginning to simmer, then add to the vegetable mixture. Bring to the boil adding seasoning to taste. Add the sprig of rosemary in a muslin bag - easier to fish out when you liquidise the soup. Simmer for about 45 minutes, skimming the surface as necessary. This soup can now be eaten either as it comes, chunky style or liquidised to make a smoother soup. If making a smoother soup, liquidise and return to the pan, heat to a simmer and add the cream. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Serve immediately.
