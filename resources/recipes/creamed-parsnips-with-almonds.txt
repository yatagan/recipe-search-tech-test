Creamed parsnips with almonds
Introduction:
A cheering vegetarian supper with a scoop of roast winter roots on top. Or try this recipe as an accompaniment to a roast. As well as being an alternative to potato mash, creamed parsnips make a good dip: just increase the amount of oil and add a little more of the cooking milk until you get a consistency you like. 
Ingredients:
500g parsnips, peeled & cut into 1–2cm chunks about 250ml almond milk 2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with a little salt juice of ½ lemon 25g ground almonds 50ml olive oil 1 tbsp flaked almonds, lightly toasted in a dry frying pan fresh parsley, chopped, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Put the parsnips in a pan, add enough almond milk just to cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and cook until very soft. Lift out the parsnips and purée in a food processor with the garlic, lemon juice, ground almonds and a little of the cooking liquid. With the machine still running, slowly add the oil. Season to taste and turn the mixture into a serving dish. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and chopped parsley before serving.
