New potato and apple salad
Introduction:
A creamy potato salad studded with tangy-sweet apple, salty cornichons and fresh chives. This is a delicious, simple vegetarian meal eaten just with some good French baguette and unsalted butter. Ideal for a light summery lunch or picnic â€“ or with barbecued meat or grilled salmon. Slices of radish or a handful of capers make good additions, as does homemade mayonnaise.
Ingredients:
500g new potatoes, cleaned & cut into bite size pieces 2 tbsp olive oil 100g cornichons or small gherkins, finely sliced 1 bunch chives or 5 spring onions, including green part, finely chopped 2 crisp, tangy eating apples 6 tbsp mayonnaise juice of 1 lemon salt & pepper
Method:
Boil potatoes in salted water until tender. Drain, cool slightly then carefully mix through olive oil, cornichons, half the chives or spring onions, salt and pepper. Peel the apples and cut into roughly 1cm dices. Quickly pour lemon juice over the apple pieces to prevent browning. When the potatoes are cool or almost cool, add the apple pieces, the mayonnaise and remaining chives or onions. Mix well, taste for seasoning and serve.
