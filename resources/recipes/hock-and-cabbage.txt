Hock and cabbage
Introduction:
This is a very cheap and delicious winter recipe. It takes quite a while to cook, but little time to prepare. This is particularly good with simple mashed potato, parsnip purée or lentils. 
Ingredients:
1 hock 1 litre milk 2 bay leaves ½ cabbage, shredded - good with hard cabbage 25g butter salt & pepper
Method:
Poach the hock in the milk and bay leaves over a low heat for 1½ hours until the meat is falling off the bone. Cook the cabbage with the butter and lots of seasoning until tender and no longer crunchy. Slice the hock and serve with the cabbage and perhaps some mashed potato or leftover lentils.
