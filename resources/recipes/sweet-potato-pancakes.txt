Sweet Potato Pancakes 
Introduction:
These sweet potato pancakes can be adapted for both sweet and savoury tastes. Serve for dinner with a roasted vegetable topping e.g. ratatouille and quick pickled red onions or leftover curry or chilli, or as a hearty breakfast, laced with a pinch of cinnamon and served with sliced banana and maple syrup or honey.
Ingredients:
2 large or 3 smaller sweet potatoes, peeled & cut into 2cm chunks 80g buckwheat flour 120ml milk 2 eggs Oil for frying Salt & pepper
Method:
Place the sweet potato in a large saucepan with a good pinch of salt. Cover with water. Bring to the boil, then simmer for approx. 15 mins, until tender, then drain and mash. While the sweet potato cooks, tip the flour into a bowl and add 120ml of milk. Crack in just one of the eggs. Whisk until smooth and lump-free. Season with salt (and a little pepper if youâ€™re using the pancakes for a savoury meal). Leave it to rest until the sweet potato is cooked and mashed. Separate the second egg into yolk and white. Whisk the egg white in a separate clean bowl until it forms stiff peaks (use an electric whisk for speed, if you have one). Weigh out 400g of sweet potato mash. Whisk it into the pancake batter with the egg yolk. Gently fold the egg white into the batter, keeping as much air in the mixture as possible. Put your oven on a low heat. Cooking in batches, depending on the size of your pan, heat 2 tbsp of oil in a large frying pan to a medium heat, not too high or the pancakes will burn before they cook through. Dollop in 2 tbsp of batter for each pancake. Cook until golden on each side and slightly risen (approx. 2-3 mins per side). Keep them warm in the oven while you cook the rest.
