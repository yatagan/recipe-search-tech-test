Shammi tikka kebabs
Introduction:
These soft, yieldy and spicy little beef patties are best eaten as a starter, or as whole meal with raita, mango chutney and flat breads or rice. Slightly acid accompaniments really complement the earthiness of the chickpeas and mince. 
Ingredients:
350g beef mince 1 onion, roughly chopped 150g chickpeas, soaked overnight & broken up by pulsing in a food processor (or in a bag with a rolling pin) 2 garlic cloves, chopped 300ml water handful chard leaves, shredded & finely chopped handful broad beans (frozen will work) 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely sliced. pinch ground cloves ½ tsp fennel seeds 1 tsp turmeric powder large pinch ground pepper 2 eggs, beaten good size bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped
Method:
Put the mince, onions, chickpeas and garlic in a saucepan with the water and simmer until the chickpeas are soft (about 30 minutes). If it gets too dry add a little more water. Add the veg and simmer for another 5 minutes. Tip everything into a colander and drain well by pushing down with a wooden spoon. Transfer to a food processor, add the chilli and spices, and pulse until evenly granular. Add the eggs and coriander and pulse again until evenly chopped. It will still feel a bit wet but don’t worry. Form into patties and fry in a non-stick pan for about 4 minutes on one side, then 3 minutes on the other. Don’t move them for the first three minutes or the mixture will break up. Allow to cool and serve with the yoghurt concoction of your choice, chutney and flatbreads.
