Mark Moody’s BBQ corn
Introduction:
A modest dish raised to legendary status by our dapper events manager, Mark, at the Abergavenny food festival a few years ago. Quoted by an unknown source as being “the food of the festival”.
Ingredients:
2 sweetcorn in their husks sea salt butter
Method:
Soak the corn in water for 30 minutes. When the BBQ coals have dropped to a steady medium heat pop the corn on the grill and cook for 20-25 minutes, turning frequently, until the husk has started to colour and burn. Peel the husk back and rub the corn with salt and butter. Devour straight from the cob using the bunched husks as a heat proof handle.
