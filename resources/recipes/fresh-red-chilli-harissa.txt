Fresh red chilli harissa
Introduction:
Harissa is a versatile, spicy North African-style sauce. There’s a huge range of ready made pastes, but homemade is even more delicious, and it means you get to control the heat levels. Drizzle over mixed root veg before roasting; use as a marinade for meat or fish; add to soups, stews and dressings for a spicy kick; or stir a little through couscous. It keeps in the fridge for a couples of weeks, covered with a layer of oil, or freeze in ice cube trays and defrost as needed. Deseed the chillies for less heat or add extra chillies if you like it hot. 
Ingredients:
3 red peppers 5 medium to hot red chillies 2 garlic cloves ½ tsp each of toasted & ground cumin, coriander & caraway seeds ¼ tsp smoked paprika 1 tbsp lemon juice, more to taste 1 tbsp red wine vinegar about 100ml olive oil
Method:
Grill the peppers, turning now and then, until the skins have blackened all over. Put in a plastic bag (this helps the skins come away) and, when cool enough to handle, peel off the skins. Remove and discard the seeds, leaving the soft flesh. Place in a food processor or blender with the remaining ingredients, except the olive oil. Blitz to a coarse paste, then gradually add the oil and blitz until you have a smoothish but fairly thick sauce.
