Toasted seed and tahini slaw with chicken wings
Introduction:
Crispy, moreish baked chicken wings make a delectable accompaniment to this tangy cabbage coleslaw, and both are very simple to make. It's best to leave the chicken to marinade overnight to allow the flavours to develop. If you want a richer coleslaw, use whole yoghurt or exchange a couple of tablespoons for mayonnaise. 
Ingredients:
1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tsp Chinese 5 spice 2 tsp Thai fish sauce 2 tsp soy sauce 3 tbsp sweet chilli sauce 12 chicken wings oil for roasting, e.g. sunflower 4 tbsp fat-free yoghurt 1 tbsp light tahini (sesame) paste juice of 1 lemon ½ Savoy cabbage, core removed, leaves very finely shredded 1 large carrots, peeled & coarsely grated 1 small red onion, very finely sliced 4 tbsp mixed seeds, e.g. sunflower, sesame, pumpkin, linseed, toasted in a dry frying pan for a min or so 1 lime, cut into wedges
Method:
In a bowl, mix together the garlic, 5 spice, fish sauce, soy and chilli sauce. Toss with the chicken, cover and chill in the fridge overnight or for 8 hours. Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Lightly grease a baking dish that will fit the wings in a fairly snug single layer. Put the chicken wings in the dish, drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle over a little sea salt. Bake until crispy and cooked through (no pink juices remaining), about 40-45 minutes. Keep an eye on them so they don’t burn. While the chicken is cooking, mix the yoghurt, tahini and lemon juice together in a large bowl. Add the cabbage, carrot, onion and toasted seeds, season with salt and pepper and toss everything together gently to combine. Serve the chicken with the lime wedges on the side to squeeze over the top.
