Celeriac, apple and spelt with blue cheese and toasted hazelnuts
Introduction:
This makes the sort of one-bowl dinner that's very welcome in winter: diced celeriac, onion and apple roasted in the oven until sweet and tender, then tossed with pearled spelt and salty blue cheese. Use veg rather than chicken stock to keep it vegetarian. You could substitute the spelt for pearl barley or farro, and use any creamy blue cheese that you like instead of Perl Las. Top with a handful of chopped fresh herbs if you have them to hand. 
Ingredients:
1 small celeriac, cut into 2cm dice 1 onion, finely diced 1 rosemary sprig, leaves very finely chopped oil for roasting, e.g. vegetable 1 apple, peeled, cored & cut into small dice 150g pearled spelt 500ml chicken or veg stock handful fresh parsley, chopped 75g Perl Las Blue cheese handful toasted hazelnuts salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Toss the celeriac, onion and rosemary on a baking tray in just enough oil to coat. Season and roast for 25-30 minutes, until tender and just starting to brown. Toss in the apple halfway through. Meanwhile, boil the spelt in the stock until tender but still with some bite, about 25 minutes. Drain or quickly boil off any excess stock. Add the roasted veg and parsley to the spelt. Crumble in some blue cheese and gently toss together. Season. Serve crumbled with a little more cheese and the toasted hazelnuts.
