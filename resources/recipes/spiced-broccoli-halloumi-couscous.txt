Spiced broccoli and halloumi couscous
Introduction:
This spicy vegetarian recipe is both light and filling. It takes only 15 minutes to prepare, so it's great for a midweek dinner – and anything you have leftover will do for a packed lunch the next day. Freshly ground spices give the best flavour, but use ready ground cumin and coriander if you're in a hurry. 
Ingredients:
½ tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp coriander seeds 1 small head broccoli with stalk, cut into florets & stalk thinly sliced large handful green beans, trimmed & cut into 2 inch pieces ½ tsp ground cinnamon 175g couscous 300ml veg stock 250g halloumi cheese, cut into 8 slices 6 cherry or 3 large tomatoes, halved or cut into chunks juice ½ lemon handful fresh coriander, chopped olive oil, to drizzle salt & pepper
Method:
In a dry frying pan toast the cumin and coriander seeds for 30 seconds or so, then crush in a pestle and mortar. Steam the broccoli and beans for about 4-5 minutes or until just tender. Combine the ground cumin, coriander and cinnamon with the couscous in a bowl. Add the stock and leave to stand for 5 minutes. In a frying pan or griddle cook the halloumi for 2 minutes each side, until lightly browned. Add the broccoli, beans, tomatoes, lemon juice and fresh coriander to the couscous. Season to taste. Serve onto plates, top with the halloumi and drizzle with olive oil.
