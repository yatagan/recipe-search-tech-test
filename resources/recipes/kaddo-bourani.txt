Kaddo bourani
Introduction:
This is the signature dish of Helmand Restaurant in Boston, costs $7.95 and it’s attracted a fair bit of acclaim. It’s been described as Afghan sweet and sour. 
Ingredients:
for the pumpkin: 2 small butternut squash or similar, about 2.5kg in total 6 tbsp veg oil 3 tbsp sugar for the yoghurt sauce: 500ml yoghurt 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 tbsp fresh mint ½ tsp salt for the meat sauce: 1 large onion, finely diced 2 tbsp veg oil 500g beef mince 1 tin chopped tomatoes 2 large garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 heaped tsp ground coriander 1 tsp salt ¼ tsp freshly ground pepper 1 tsp ground turmeric 2 tbsp tomato paste
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas Mark 2. For the squash, peel, deseed and chop it into large chunks. Put in a bowl and toss in the oil and sugar until evenly coated. Place the pieces in a single layer on a large baking tray, cover with foil and bake for 2½ hours. Give it a good shake a couple of times during cooking. The sugar will get absorbed into the squash which should turn a caramelised dark orange. Meanwhile, make the yoghurt sauce. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. To make the meat sauce, sauté the onion in the oil in a heavy pan. Add the meat and cook over a medium-high heat, stirring, until it is broken up into small pieces and evenly browned. Add all the other ingredients and cook, stirring, for another 5 minutes or so. Lower the heat and let simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes.
