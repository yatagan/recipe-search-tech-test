Mexican one-pot courgettes
Introduction:
This easy, rewarding recipe makes an excellent dinner for a busy evening â€“ it just requires chucking everything in a pot and waiting. These flavourings are unusual for courgettes, which are generally treated in a Mediterranean way. Serve with rice or bread to soak up the juices. 
Ingredients:
750g courgettes, cut into small dice 350g tomatoes, skinned, deseeded & chopped (or use tinned tomatoes) 6 peppercorns 4 sprigs fresh coriander 2 sprigs fresh mint 3 cloves 2cm piece cinnamon stick 2 small chillies, left whole 120ml single cream salt & pepper
Method:
Put everything in a large, heavy-based pan, cover and bring to a simmer. Cook slowly for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the courgettes are tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. This sometimes tastes even better reheated the next day.
