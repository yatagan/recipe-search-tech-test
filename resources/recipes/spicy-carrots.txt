Spicy carrots
Introduction:
This easy, punchy salad is based around something we served one Curry Wednesday in the staff canteen. It's a great way to use up all the ends of spices that you have ground for your main curry – you needn't stick to cumin. You could also eat this as a light lunch with a few torn leaves of mint and creamy feta cheese crumbled over the top. Try toasted pittas and hummus on the side. 
Ingredients:
3-4 carrots 1 small red onion, finely sliced ¼ celeriac or 1 parsnip or 1 small beetroot, or a mixture of all ½ tsp poppy seeds 1 tsp black onion seeds ½ tsp cumin seeds, toasted & ground 1.5cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 2 tbsp veg oil ½ tbsp brown sugar 1-2 tbsp lemon or lime juice salt & pepper
Method:
Grate the carrots and any other root veg and mix all ingredients. Add lemon or lime juice, sugar and salt and pepper to season bit by bit to taste.
