Quick lamb kebabs with courgette and cucumber tzatziki
Introduction:
These cigars of light spiced lamb are delicious with rice or couscous, salad and fresh, tangy tzatziki. They're good for the barbecue season, but also easy enough for a weeknight supper. You could add finely chopped mint and parsley to the lamb, along with minced pine nuts for a bit of crunch. 
Ingredients:
for the tzatziki: ½ cucumber 1 large courgette 2 garlic cloves, crushed 400ml plain yoghurt juice of 1 lemon, or to taste a few fresh mint leaves (about 6), chopped for the kebabs: 450g minced lamb 1 onion, finely chopped 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander ¼ tsp cinnamon or allspice 1 egg a little oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower
Method:
Make the tzatziki: Cut the cucumber in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds from the middle. Finely julienne or grate both the cucumber and the courgette. Place in a bowl, add the garlic, yoghurt and lemon juice to taste. Combine. Add the mint leaves and carefully stir to mix. Taste and add a little salt if needed. To make the kebabs, put the lamb in a food processor and blitz until very finely minced. Add the onion, spices and egg and blitz again to combine. Remove from the processor and divide into eight portions, making them into a shape about the size of a large egg. Carefully push a skewer through each kebab. Mould the mixture along the kebab to form a sausage shape. Heat a little oil on a griddle, BBQ or in a large frying pan and fry the kebabs, turning occasionally, for about 10-12 minutes, until cooked through. Serve with tzatziki.
