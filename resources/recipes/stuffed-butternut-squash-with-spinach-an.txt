Stuffed butternut squash with spinach and couscous
Introduction:
This satisfying and healthy vegetarian main is fancy enough for dinner parties while being fairly simple to make. It's good to eat both warm and at room temperature, and goes well with a crisp green salad. 
Ingredients:
1 butternut squash olive oil 150g couscous ½ onion, chopped 1 red pepper, chopped (optional) 1 garlic clove, sliced ½ tin tomatoes or 200g tomatoes 1 tsp sugar bunch chard or spinach splash balsamic vinegar 50g toasted pine nuts spring onions, finely sliced fresh herbs, e.g. chives, parsley, mint, coriander, chopped 50-100g feta, crumbled salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Cut the squash lengthways, remove seeds, brush with olive oil, season and bake for 30 minutes until cooked through. Scoop out a little of the flesh, dice it and put to one side. Prepare couscous by seasoning in a bowl and rubbing olive oil through it with your fingers. Cover with boiling water then seal the bowl with clingfilm and leave for 5 minutes to steam. Fluff up with a fork. Sweat the onion (& red pepper) in oil for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a few more minutes. Add the tomatoes and sugar and reduce down for 10-15 minutes. Blanch the spinach/chard for a minute then squeeze out the water, chop roughly. Add to the tomato sauce, mix through adding couscous and vinegar, toasted pine nuts, spring onions, herbs and finish by folding through the squash and feta. Season, return to the squash case and bake for 10 minutes. Serve with green salad.
