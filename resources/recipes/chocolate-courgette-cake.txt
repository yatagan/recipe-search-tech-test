Chocolate courgette cake
Introduction:
Courgettes make a cake moist and sweet, a little as ground almonds do. We like to use this recipe to persuade children of the virtues of vegetables. It is a regular feature of the lunch we prepare for Landscove Primary School and the children love it. 
Ingredients:
120g softened unsalted butter 125ml sunflower oil 100g caster sugar 200g soft brown sugar 3 eggs, lightly beaten 130ml milk 350g plain flour 2 tsp baking powder 4 tbsp cocoa powder 450g courgettes, peeled & finely grated 1 tsp vanilla extract
Method:
Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Grease a 20x35cm baking tin and line with baking parchment. Put the butter, sunflower oil and both sugars in a bowl and beat them together until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs and then the milk. Sift the dry ingredients together and fold them into the butter mixture. Stir in the courgettes and vanilla, then spoon the mixture into the tin. Bake for 35–45 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cut into squares whilst still warm.
