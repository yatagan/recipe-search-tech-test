Spider crab and samphire salad, with new potatoes and roasted tomatoes
Introduction:
Make this summer salad to celebrate the brief samphire season. It calls for a few steps of preparation, but the result is a great combination of intense roasted tomatoes, salty samphire, tender potatoes and fresh crab. Spider crab has a lovely light, sweet flavour, but if you can't find it use brown crab instead. 
Ingredients:
12 cherry tomatoes, cut in ½ crossways 4 tbsp olive oil 800g new potatoes, scrubbed clean & cut in ½ or ¼’s, depending on size 200g samphire, washed 200g cooked white spider crab meat few basil leaves, shredded few tarragon leaves, shredded lemon juice, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Put the cherry tomatoes on a non-stick baking tray and drizzle with a couple of tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for 30-40 minutes. They should be sticky and just starting to caramelise. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. While the tomatoes are cooking, put the potatoes in a pan of salted water. Bring to the boil and cook the potatoes for about 10 -15 minutes, depending on size, until tender. Drain and leave to cool. Cook the samphire in another pan of boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and plunge into a pan of cold water, then drain again and leave to cool. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, tomatoes, samphire, crab meat and herbs. Add the rest of the olive oil and lemon juice to taste and season with black pepper. You probably won’t need any extra salt to season, as the samphire is salty enough, but taste before you serve.
