Root vegetable pie
Introduction:
This rustic and hearty pie is simple to construct and makes a splendid dinner on a cold day. As long as you drain the vegetables thoroughly, the pie can be made in advance and whipped into the oven an hour before you plan to eat. You can vary the veg you use – swede and parsnip would fit in well. This is good with sautéed greens. 
Ingredients:
450g carrots, peeled & sliced 450g potatoes, peeled & sliced 225g turnips, peeled & sliced 50g butter plus extra for greasing tin 450g puff pastry, thawed if frozen flour for rolling out 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 tsp caraway seeds 1 egg, beaten
Method:
Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Cook the carrot slices for about 6 minutes, then scoop out and drain. Repeat with potatoes and turnips, keeping each vegetable separate. Butter a loose-bottomed cake tin, 5cm deep by 20cm in diameter. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured board to give a rough circle of about 33cm in diameter. Loosely fold in half and then quarters, then lift into the tin and gently push the pastry down to line the sides of the tin using a small knob of the pastry rolled into a ball to ease it right into the corner. Make separate layers of potatoes, carrots, and turnips, sprinkling parsley, caraway seeds, salt and pepper between layers and dotting with butter as you go. Roll out the remaining pastry and lay over the pie. Trim off excess and press the edges of the patsy together firmly. Make a hole in the centre, then let it rest for 30 minutes in the fridge. Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 8. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg and bake for 10 minutes until golden brown. Reduce the heat to 180°C/Gas 4 and cook for a further 50-60 minutes. Test with a skewer to check that the vegetables are cooked and tender. Unmould carefully and serve hot or warm.
