Pork and cider casserole
Introduction:
This recipe is low maintenance and all the more delicious for it. Ashridge cider is particularly good here, it has a great depth of flavour; though maybe we’re biased as it’s made right next door to us in Devon. If you have a turnip or two lying around they work really well in this recipe, though the casserole will be just as good without them. 
Ingredients:
300g pork, diced 1 tbsp seasoned white flour 2 slices streaky bacon, cut into lardons 2 tbsp sunflower oil 2 medium onions, sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 200ml dry cider 1 bay leaf sprig thyme 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp brown sugar 300g turnip, diced
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas ½. Mix the diced pork with the flour. Heat the oil in a heavy casserole pan over the hob and evenly brown the pork and bacon all over. Remove them from the pan using a slotted spoon. Turn down the heat and soften the onions for 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further 2 minutes. Return the meat to the pan and add the mustard, cider, herbs, vinegar, sugar and turnips if you have them. Bring the whole thing to a simmer, transfer to the oven or a slow cooker and cook gently on a very low heat until the meat and turnips are tender.
