Summer cider chicken and vegetable stew
Introduction:
A fresh, veg-filled summer chicken stew. If using large broad beans, blanch them in boiling water for 3 minutes, drain, refresh in cold water and peel off the outer shell to leave the bright green inner bean. If they're small, put them in the stew as they are. Serve on its own, or with bread or new potatoes crushed with a little garlic and olive oil or butter. 
Ingredients:
1.5kg chicken pieces (thighs & drumsticks) 2 tbsp olive oil 350ml medium-dry cider 3 tarragon sprigs 250g carrots, peeled & chopped into bite-sized pieces 200g summer turnips, peeled & chopped into bite-sized pieces (or use more carrots) 300g green beans – this could be a mix of any of: sugar snaps, French beans, podded broad beans 150g crème frâiche handful fresh chives or parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the chicken pieces in a large bowl with the olive oil. Season well and toss to coat all the pieces in oil. Heat a large flameproof casserole dish. Fry the chicken in batches, turning once, until golden brown. Remove and keep on a plate until all have been browned, then put all the pieces back in the pan. Add the cider and tarragon sprigs, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer gently on the lowest heat for about 40 minutes. Add the carrots and turnips, if using. Simmer for another 10-15 minutes. Add the beans, increase the heat a little and cook for 5 minutes. Add the crème fraîche, stir to combine, and heat for another 2 minutes. Add the parsley or chives to serve.
