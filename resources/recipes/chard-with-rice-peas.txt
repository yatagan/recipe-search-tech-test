Chard with rice and peas
Introduction:
This quick, healthy dish can be eaten on its own for a midweek dinner, spiced up with a little fried chorizo or some mushrooms, or enjoyed as a side to sausages or pork chops. Short grain rice is best for this recipe, but long grain rice works too as an alternative. 
Ingredients:
3 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, peeled & finely sliced 1 tsp paprika 1 head chard, washed, stems removed & finely sliced, leaves shredded 100g rice (short grain is best) handful frozen peas (optional) zest & juice of 1 lemon handful fresh herbs, chopped, or use 1 tsp dried mixed herbs if not available salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the onion and fry gently until soft. Add paprika, chard, rice and 125ml water. Cover and simmer until the rice is about 5 minutes from being cooked, then add the peas if using. Cook until the rice is tender and the peas are cooked, season and add the lemon juice and zest, and herbs, to finish.
