Wild garlic chickpea curry 
Introduction:
What’s so wild? Garlic leaves, or ‘ramsons’ as they’re known. A seasonal treat, we have special licence to pick ours, treading carefully on the land. It’s tasty in this chana masala style curry - chana translating as chickpeas. 
Ingredients:
150g brown basmati rice 1 leek 1 chilli 1 tin chickpeas 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp brown mustard seeds ½ tsp ground ginger ½ tsp turmeric 1 tin chopped tomatoes 50g wild garlic 10g mint 1 tsp garam masala 1 lemon mango chutney
Method:
Rinse the rice, transfer to a saucepan, cover with boiled water and simmer for 25 mins, until tender. Trim and halve the leek, lengthways. Finely slice and wash well to remove grit. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large saucepan and fry the leek on a low-medium heat for 5 mins, stirring now and then. Deseed and chop the chilli. Drain the chickpeas. Add the chickpeas, chilli to your taste for heat, and all the spices except the garam masala. Fry for 1 min, stirring so the spices don’t stick. Tip in the tomatoes. Half fill the empty tin with water; add that too. Season then simmer for 12 mins. Shred the wild garlic leaves and most of the mint leaves. After 10 mins, add the wild garlic and cook until wilted in, approx 3-4 mins. Stir in the garam masala. Add more seasoning and a good squeeze of lemon juice, all to taste. Drain the rice and serve with the curry, shredded mint to garnish and mango chutney on the side.
