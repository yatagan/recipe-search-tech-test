Spanish-style Swiss chard with chickpeas
Introduction:
Swiss chard is a favourite in Spanish kitchens and in this recipe Riverford Cook Anna pairs it with classic Hispanic ingredients – smoked paprika, chickpeas and garlic. It’s lovely warm out of the pan, but even better if left to infuse for an hour and eaten at room temperature. 
Ingredients:
2 large heads or bunches of Swiss chard (500g–600g) 2–3 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra for garnishing 1 onion, thinly sliced 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1 x 400g can chickpeas, drained 1½ tsp smoked paprika ¼ tsp cayenne pepper 2 tsp sherry vinegar, or to taste salt & black pepper
Method:
Detach the chard leaves from the stems. Cut the stems into 2cm lengths and the leaves into 5cm-wide ribbons. Blanch and squeeze the chard stems and leaves. Heat the olive oil in a wide frying pan and cook the onion with a pinch of salt on a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and cook a further 2 minutes. Add the chickpeas, chard stems, paprika and cayenne and cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring often. Finally, stir in the chard leaves and cook for a further 3–4 minutes. To finish, season with salt and pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and a couple of splashes of sherry vinegar to brighten the flavour.
