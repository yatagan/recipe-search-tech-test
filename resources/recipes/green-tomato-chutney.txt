Green tomato chutney
Introduction:
This is a great use for tomatoes that stubbornly won't ripen. If you're not using new jars, to help prevent re-used jars smelling of their previous contents, add a little bicarbonate of soda and hot water, leave for a couple of minutes, then rinse well before using. To sterilise jars: wash and leave jars to air dry. Place cold jars on a baking tray in a cold oven. Heat to 150C/Gas 2 for 15 minutes. Sterilise lids by boiling for 10 minutes then leaving to dry thoroughly before using, or once you've potted your chutney, pop on clean, dry lids and invert the jars for 10 mins to let the hot chutney sterilise them, before turning right-way up. Always pot hot chutney into hot jars. This recipe should make about 1kg chutney.
Ingredients:
750g green tomatoes, washed & chopped 350g shallots or onions, chopped 200g cooking apples, peeled, cored & chopped 300ml malt vinegar 2 red chillies small piece fresh root ginger, peeled a few yellow mustard seeds (optional) 100g raisins 1 tsp salt 200g brown sugar
Method:
Put the tomatoes, shallots or onions and apples in a large, heavy-based, non-reactive pan, with half the vinegar. Bring to the boil then gently cook for about 30 minutes, until tender. Tie the chillies, ginger and mustard seeds (if using) in a muslin bag. Bruise with a heavy rolling pin or hammer and add to the pan with the raisins. Cook on a low heat, stirring from time to time, until the mixture thickens (about 1 hour). Add the salt, sugar and the rest of the vinegar, stirring well until the sugar dissolves. Continue cooking until the mixture has thickened. Remove the muslin spice bag. Pot into sterilised jars while the chutney is still warm. Seal. Leave for 6 weeks to mature.
