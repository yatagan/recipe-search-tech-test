Escarole and bacon
Introduction:
Lettuce-like escarole is the mildest of the endive/chicory/radicchio family. Salty, smoked bacon sets off its slightly bitter taste beautifully. A good addition to this salad is crunchy slices of sweet apple. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp red vinegar 1 tsp honey 115g streaky smoked bacon, diced, ideally quite fatty balsamic or sherry vinegar 1 head escarole salt & pepper
Method:
First make the dressing by combining the mustard, oil, vinegar and honey. Season to taste. Discard any ratty outer leaves of the escarole. Roughly chop. Fry the bacon until just starting to crisp. Add the to the hot pan to deglaze. Remove from the heat and stir in a little of the dressing. Toss the bacon and the warm dressing with the escarole and serve immediately as a starter.
