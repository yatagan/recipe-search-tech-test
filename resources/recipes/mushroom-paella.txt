Mushroom Paella with smoky chickpeas
Introduction:
A vegan paella, still made with saffron but given a twist by adding roasted chickpeas tossed in paprika for a smoky flavour.
Ingredients:
1 onion, peel & diced⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 2 garlic cloves, peeled & chopped⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 red pepper, deseeded & sliced ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 yellow pepper, deseeded & sliced ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 200g mushrooms, finely sliced⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 4 tomatoes, diced⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 lemon, halved⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 tsp light brown sugar⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 150g arborio rice⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 tin chickpeas⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 paella spice mix (1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tbsp bouillon powder, 1tsp dried thyme) pinch of saffron⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1 tsp smoked paprika ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 15g parsley, finely chopped⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 15g sorrel, roughly shredded⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 20g flaked almonds
Method:
Pre-heat your oven to 200C/Gas 6 Sprinkle the cut sides of lemon with sugar. Place cut-side down in a large, deep frying pan & heat until caramelised, then transfer to a plate. Heat 2 tbsp of oil in the same pan. Gently fry the onion on a low heat for 10 mins; stir now & then. Rinse the rice in a sieve. Drain the chickpeas into a colander, rinse under cold water, pat dry with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel, & leave to air dry for 5 mins. Toss the dried chickpeas on a baking tray in oil to coat. Season with salt. Roast for 30 mins, until crispy on the outside. Toss every 10 mins so they roast evenly. Some may pop a bit. Meanwhile, add the garlic, mushrooms & pepper to the onion. Stir. Add the rice, tomatoes, paella spice mix, saffron & ½ the smoked paprika. Pour in 600ml of water. Season. Boil for 25-30 mins, adding more water as needed. Stir occasionally, until the rice is tender with a little bite. Put the almonds on a baking tray. Bake them for 2-4 mins (keep a good eye on them), until golden. Toss the cooked chickpeas in the remaining smoked paprika. Toss the sorrel with the rice. Season. Serve the paella, sprinkled with the chickpeas, almonds & parsley, & with the caramelised lemon for squeezing.
