Celery, cheese and walnut grill
Introduction:
This is a good take on a vegetable that's often in the background of salads and soups. Creamy cheese and crunchy walnuts make it a quick and easy centrepiece. If you want more of a Waldorf salad taste use blue cheese instead of Cheddar. 
Ingredients:
8 celery sticks 125g Cheddar 75g walnuts, roughly chopped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
Method:
Preheat the grill. Cut celery into 10cm lengths and place in an ovenproof dish. Mix the cheese, walnuts and garlic together and press into celery. Grill until cheese melts.
