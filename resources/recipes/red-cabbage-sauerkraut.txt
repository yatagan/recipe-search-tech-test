Red cabbage sauerkraut
Introduction:
Fermented foods are achingly hip at the moment. Kimchi, sauerkraut and kefir abound on restaurant menus. We are rediscovering the sharp, savoury tang that comes from a lactic acid fermentation. It is generally believed to be terribly good for your belly. Veer from the tried and tested path of braised red cabbage and try a bit of home brewing. Perfect piled next to your bangers and mash or with creamy smashed avocado on toast. TIP: When fermenting, itâ€™s important to ensure your jars are squeaky clean to avoid contamination. The easiest method is to stick the jars in the dishwasher (removing the rubber seals first). Alternatively, wash the jars in hot, soapy water, then rinse well. Put them on a tray in a low temperature oven for 15 mins. Leave to cool.
Ingredients:
1 small red cabbage sea salt caraway seeds juniper berries 1 large kilner jar or crock
Method:
Trim the outside leaves from the cabbage and put to one side. Quarter the cabbage and cut away any sold root core. Slice the cabbage and weigh it. For every 500g of sliced cabbage add 10g of sea salt. Massage it for 5 -10 minutes, working and turning with your hands (wear gloves if you want to avoid staining). The cabbage should get quite wet. Add a quarter teaspoon of caraway seeds and a 4-5 lightly crushed juniper berries. Pack tightly into a jar or crock and place a cabbage leaf on top. Place a weight on top. The liquid should cover the cabbage completely. If there is not enough liquid make a 2% brine (20g salt to 1litre of water) and add enough to cover. Keep at room temperature in a dark corner. During the first week open the lid to release some of the gas that builds up. It should be ready to eat after 1-2 weeks but can be left a little longer to let the flavour develop. When ready you can transfer it to a sterilized jar and store in the fridge until the fancy grabs you. Should store for about a month.
