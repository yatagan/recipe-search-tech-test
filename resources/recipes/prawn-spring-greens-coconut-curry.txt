Prawn, spring greens and coconut curry
Introduction:
This is a well-spiced, super-quick prawn, spring greens and coconut curry which can pretty much be on the table in the time it takes the rice to cook. Vary the veggies as much as you like â€“ add strips of carrots, peppers, beans and broccoli. You can also leave out the prawns if you're vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp tamarind paste 1 tsp chilli powder 1 tsp cumin seeds, ground in a pestle & mortar (or use ready-ground) 1 tsp ground turmeric 50ml hot water 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 2 bunches spring greens, tough stalks removed, leaves shredded 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 400g (peeled weight) raw tiger or large prawns (defrosted if frozen) 2-3cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped or grated 1 fresh chilli, finely chopped, use the seeds too if you like it hot 200ml water 150ml coconut milk large handful fresh coriander, chopped 1 lime
Method:
Put the tamarind paste in a small bowl with the chilli powder, ground cumin, turmeric and hot water. Stir well to combine and leave to one side. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok, add the spring greens and garlic and stir-fry over a medium heat for a minute or two. Add the prawns, ginger and fresh chilli and stir-fry for another 2 minutes. Add the tamarind water, extra water and coconut milk, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, until the prawns are cooked through. Add the chopped coriander and season with salt to taste. Squeeze over a little lime juice to serve. Serve with boiled basmati rice.
