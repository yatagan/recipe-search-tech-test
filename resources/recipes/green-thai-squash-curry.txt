Green thai squash curry
Introduction:
A dead easy, vegan squash curry, this gets its creaminess from coconut milk, a fresh kick from limes and fresh coriander, and a good crunch from sprouting seeds. It's a great midweek meal served with brown basmati rice or any other grain you like. To keep this quick you can go with shop-bought Thai green curry paste if you don't want to make your own – but it's even better if you do. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, eg. vegetable or sunflower 1 onion or 2 shallots, finely sliced 6 tbsp homemade thai green curry paste 1 large butternut or 2 smaller squash, peeled & cut into 4-5cm chunks (approx 1kg diced weight) 400ml tin coconut milk 2 limes ½ pack mixed sprouting seeds 30g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoon of oil in a large pan. Add the onion and fry on a low heat for 7-8 minutes, stirring to stop it catching. Add the curry paste and stir for 1 minute. Add the squash. Stir the tin of coconut milk and add to the pan with half a tin of water. Simmer for approx 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender. Stir in the sprouting seeds. Season and squeeze in lime juice to taste. Stir in the coriander, saving a few leaves for garnishing. Serve with rice.
