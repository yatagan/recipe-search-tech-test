Spinach and ricotta penne
Introduction:
A good, child-friendly weeknight dinner, this recipe can be on the table in less than 20 minutes. Substitute the Parmesan to make it vegetarian. Penne holds the sauce particularly well for this, but any other pasta would be fine. 
Ingredients:
400g penne 400g spinach, washed 50g butter fresh sage or marjoram, chopped small garlic clove, crushed to a paste 75g ricotta, crumbled 50g Parmesan, grated pinch nutmeg, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta according to packet instructions. Meanwhile, blanch the spinach in salted water for 2 minutes, drain well and press out excess water when cool. Chop finely. Melt the butter in a pan, add the herbs and garlic and cook for a minute. Add spinach and braise for a further 2 minutes. Add hot drained pasta, cheese, nutmeg and seasoning. Mix together and serve.
