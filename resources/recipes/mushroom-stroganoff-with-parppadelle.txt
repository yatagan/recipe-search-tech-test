Mushroom stroganoff with pappardelle
Introduction:
Mushroom Stroganoff was, for years, the default veggie option on every gastro pub menu before being knocked from its perch by the ubiquitous risotto. Dare I say, it could now be considered as retro. It works just as well with rice as it does with pasta. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, sliced 200g mushrooms, sliced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 1 tsp sweet smoked paprika 1 tsp tomato purée 1 tsp Dijon mustard 100ml vegetable stock 200g pappardelle pasta 3 tbsp soured cream 1 lemon small bunch fresh dill, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put a pan of salted water on to boil. Fry the onion for 10 minutes in until starting to softened and colour. Add the mushrooms and garlic, turn up the heat, fry for 5 minutes stirring occasionally. Add the paprika, tomato purèe and mustard, cook for 1 minute. Tip in the stock and let it bubble away for 5 minutes until reduced by half. Throw the pasta into the water and set a timer for 10 minutes. When the stock has reduced add the sour cream, simmer for 3 minutes. Check the seasoning for salt & pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice to taste. Drain the pasta well and dress with olive oil. Scatter over the dill to serve.
