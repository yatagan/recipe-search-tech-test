Celeriac salad with yoghurt dressing
Introduction:
This is a somewhere in between coleslaw and celeriac r√©moulade and uses yoghurt instead of mayonnaise for a lighter finish. It can be garnished with parsley, capers or chopped gherkins. This vegetarian winter salad goes beautifully with salmon and chicken. 
Ingredients:
500g celeriac juice of 1 lemon 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp yoghurt 1 tbsp white wine vinegar 1 tsp English mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Peel and chop the celeriac into matchsticks and put them into a bowl of cold water then add the lemon juice. Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and add the celeriac. Bring back to the boil, blanching the celeriac, then drain and rinse. Pat dry with a cloth. For the dressing put the oil, yoghurt, white wine vinegar, English mustard, salt and pepper in a jar, shake it up and mix with the celeriac.
