Leek and ham bake
Introduction:
A marriage made in heaven. If this doesn’t warm the soul I don’t know what will. If you shred the ham and leeks instead of rolling them this dish is amazing as a topping for a fluffy jacket potato or mixed with cooked macaroni and baked. 
Ingredients:
50g butter 50g plain flour 400ml warm whole milk 70g mature Cheddar, grated 30g Parmesan, grated ¼ nutmeg, grated 1 tsp English mustard pinch of cayenne 4 leeks, trimmed & cleaned 8 slices prosciutto or serrano ham fresh breadcrumbs
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas mark 5. Melt the butter, add the flour and mix until a smooth paste forms. Slowly add the warm milk, stirring all the time until you have a thick sauce. Stir in the cheeses, nutmeg, mustard and cayenne. Steam or boil the leeks until just cooked. Lay two slices of ham together, slightly overlapping. Place one leek at the bottom and roll up tight like a sausage roll. Repeat with the other 3. Pack in a snug oven dish and pour over the sauce. Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and bake until golden & bubbling.
