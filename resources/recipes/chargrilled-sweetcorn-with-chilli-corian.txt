Chargrilled sweetcorn with chilli and coriander butter
Introduction:
This is a hardy recipe that doesn't require any scrupulousness â€“ good for outdoor barbecues or parties. It's great as a starter, or with grilled chicken or meaty white fish. It washes down very well with a cold beer. 
Ingredients:
2 halved or 4 whole ears of sweetcorn, husks removed 2 tsp olive oil 2 tbsp butter 1 red chilli, deseeded & very finely chopped, or more to taste squeeze of lime handful fresh coriander, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the sweetcorn in unsalted water for 4 minutes until just tender and drain. Heat a cast iron griddle or heavy frying pan. Smear the corn all over with a little vegetable or olive oil and place on the griddle or pan. Cook quickly on all sides so that the corn has light scorch marks all over. Remove to a serving plate. Meanwhile heat the butter in a small saucepan. When it has melted add the chilli and allow to infuse for a few minutes. Add the lime juice and salt and pepper. Just before serving, stir through the coriander and pour over the chargrilled corn.
