Cumin roasted cauliflower with tahini tarator dip
Introduction:
Tarator is Eastern European and Middle Eastern in origin. Recipes vary; in Turkey it’s made from walnuts and garlic, this version using tahini is more Lebanese in style. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, cut into florets ½ tsp toasted cumin seeds, ground in a pestle & mortar with a good pinch of salt 2 tbsp rapeseed or olive oil 100g tahini paste juice of 1 lemon, more to taste 150ml milk or plain yogurt 2 tbsp grated carrot 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tbsp fresh mint, chopped ¼ tsp cayenne pepper 2 tbsp fresh white breadcrumbs salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Put the cauliflower in a baking dish. Toss with the cumin and oil. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, until just tender. Keep an eye on them, cover with foil if necessary, toss them once or twice during cooking to stop them over-browning. To make the dip, whisk the tahini and lemon juice in a bowl. Gradually stir in the milk or yoghurt. Stir in the rest of the ingredients. Season. Add more lemon juice to taste. Serve the cauliflower warm, with the dip.
