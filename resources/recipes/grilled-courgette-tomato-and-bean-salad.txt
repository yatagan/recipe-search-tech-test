Grilled courgette, tomato and bean salad with basil dressing
Introduction:
We served this salad the day we opened the Field Kitchen and it's one of the recipes we're most often asked for. It's a great lunch on its own with a hunk of bread, or can be bulked up with grilled peppers and aubergines. It is very good paired with lamb. 
Ingredients:
200g dried cannellini or haricot beans, soaked in cold water overnight & drained 3 tbsp olive oil 4 courgettes, cut into ribbons 5mm thick 1 small punnet of cherry tomatoes, cut in half 1 bunch basil Â½ garlic clove, crushed 100ml olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Put the drained beans in a large pan, cover with fresh water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour or so, until tender. Drain, season to taste and dress with two tablespoons of the olive oil. Toss the courgettes in the remaining olive oil and grill on a ridged griddle pan (or under a hot grill) until tender and lightly charred. For the dressing, put the basil, garlic and olive oil in a food processor or blender and whiz until smooth. Gently mix the beans, tomatoes and courgettes together in a large bowl and add enough basil dressing to coat. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
