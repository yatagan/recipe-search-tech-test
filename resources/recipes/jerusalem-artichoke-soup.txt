Jerusalem artichoke soup
Introduction:
Blended Jerusalem artichokes have an unparalleled silkiness that makes for a luxurious soup. It's surprisingly filling â€“ enough for a meal on its own with some thickly buttered farmhouse bread. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped 500g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed & thinly sliced 800ml chicken or vegetable stock 100ml single cream salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large pan, add the onion and fry gently for 5 minutes. Add the artichokes and stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes, until the artichokes are tender. Blend the mixture until smooth, then season to taste and reheat gently. Stir in the cream and serve.
