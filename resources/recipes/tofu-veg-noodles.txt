Tofu tom yum with veg ‘noodles’
Introduction:
This is our light but sustaining take on a traditional Asian dish, with ribbons of veg and mushrooms, lightly simmered in an aromatic lemongrass and miso broth with crunchy sprouts and marinated tofu strips. The dish is finished with a sriracha, a sauce made from chilli pepper, garlic, vinegar, a little sugar and salt (named after a city in Thailand where it originated).
Ingredients:
2 tbsp brown miso 1 tbsp tamari ½ tbsp bouillon powder 1 garlic clove ½ tsp ground ginger 1 lemongrass 2 courgettes 2 carrots 150g mushrooms 15g parsley 200g marinated tofu 2 handfuls mixed sprouts 1 tbsp dried coriander leaves 1-2 tbsp sriracha - add to taste salt & pepper 1 lime
Method:
Put the miso, tamari and bouillon in a large saucepan. Add 1 litre of water and bring to a simmer. Peel and finely grate the garlic. Add to the saucepan as soon as it’s ready, along with the ground ginger. Bash the lemongrass stalk so the base splits slightly. Put that in the pan, too. Simmer the mix while you continue. Trim the courgettes. Peel long ribbon like pieces, working down and round until you reach the seedy core. Do the same with the carrots. In batches, lay a stack of courgette ribbons on top of each other and halve them, lengthways (they don’t have to be perfect!). Do the same with the carrot. Thinly slice the mushrooms. Finely chop the parsley. Slice the tofu into 1cm strips. Into the broth, stir the mushrooms and a couple of handfuls of mixed sprouts. Simmer for 2 mins. Stir in the dried coriander leaves, courgette and carrot. Simmer for approx. 1 min, until the veg is starting to soften but retains a little bite. Stir in enough sriracha to your taste for heat (we suggest 1 tbsp to start with). Remove the lemongrass. Season and add lime juice to taste. Divide the broth between wide bowls. Top with the tofu and sprinkle over the parsley to serve.
