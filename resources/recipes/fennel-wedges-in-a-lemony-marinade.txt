Fennel wedges in a lemony marinade
Introduction:
This easy, healthy side goes particularly well with griddled fish and meat. You can substitute some of the fennel with leeks if you like. 
Ingredients:
4 fennel bulbs, cut into wedges juice of 2 lemons 1 tbsp sugar 100ml water coriander or parsley, chopped
Method:
Blanch 4 whole trimmed fennels in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain and refresh in cold water. Drain well, brush lightly with oil and sear on a hot griddle pan. In a wide pan, gently heat the juice of 2 lemons, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 100ml water. As the fennels come off the grill, place in the warm marinade. Leave for 5 minutes, then sprinkle with chopped coriander or parsley and serve.
