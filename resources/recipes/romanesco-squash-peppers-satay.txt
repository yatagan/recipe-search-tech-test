Romanesco, squash and peppers with satay dipping sauce
Introduction:
Satay sauce is very easy to make and super versatile. It goes with anything from chicken or pork kebabs to spring rolls or, as here, a range of roasted, blanched and raw veg. Either pour over the veg as a dressing, or serve in a bowl and use your fingers to dip. 
Ingredients:
1 small butternut squash, peeled & cut into 3-4cm dice oil for roasting, e.g. vegetable 2 red peppers, deseeded & chopped 1 Romanesco, cut into even sized florets for the satay dipping sauce: 175g crunchy peanut butter 3 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar 1 tsp light brown sugar or honey juice of 1-2 limes, to taste 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 tsp fresh ginger, finely chopped 2 hot red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped about 80ml coconut milk
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. Put the squash in a roasting dish and toss in just enough oil to coat. It will take 35-40 minutes to cook; turn half way through so it cooks evenly. Add the peppers for the last 15 minutes. Blanch the Romanesco uncovered in boiling water until tender. For the satay: Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and add enough coconut milk to thin it to a thick dipping consistency. You can add a little water to thin further if needed. Add more soy, lime juice or a pinch of sugar to taste.
