Spiced duck, cabbage and noodle broth
Introduction:
Succulent duck works beautifully with these strong, spicy flavours, making a full-flavoured and virtuous dinner for a chilly evening. You can use any type of green cabbage in this recipe, although Savoy and January King are probably the best. 
Ingredients:
1 duck breast oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 tsp Thai 7 spice (or use Chinese 5 spice) 150g or Â½ small cabbage (any green cabbage will work), finely shredded 1 small garlic clove, crushed (optional) 1-2cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated (optional) 100g dried egg noodles 500ml hot chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Score the duck skin and season with the spice, salt and pepper. Heat a frying pan, add the duck breast, skin side down and fry for 3-4 minutes on a fairly high heat. Turn the duck over, lower the heat and fry for another 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and leave to rest. Meanwhile, in another pan, heat a little oil and add the cabbage, garlic and ginger (if using). Fry for 3 minutes until just tender, but still with some bite. Season. At the same time as you fry the cabbage, put the noodles in a saucepan with the hot stock and simmer for 3 minutes, until just cooked. Pour into two serving bowls. Add half the cabbage to the side of each bowl, thinly slice the duck and arrange on the other side to serve.
