Leek and smoked cheese macaroni
Introduction:
An excellent midweek meal. Using wholewheat macaroni and including leeks makes this easy pasta bake a little more nutritious and interesting than traditional macaroni, but just as comforting. Smoked Cheddar and leeks are a good combination of sharp and sweet, but you can play around with the type of cheese – a piquant blue cheese also works (although might be less popular with children). 
Ingredients:
100g wholewheat macaroni olive oil 100g leeks, shredded 10g butter 10g flour ½ tsp Dijon mustard 200ml milk 50g smoked Cheddar, grated, & a little extra for topping 1 tbsp breadcrumbs (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Boil the pasta in salted water for 8 minutes. Drain and toss in a little olive oil. Meanwhile, gently cook the leeks in butter for 8 minutes. Add the flour to the leeks and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in the mustard. Gradually stir in the milk. Add the cheese and heat gently, stirring, to thicken the sauce. Season to taste. Transfer to a small baking dish and sprinkle over a little more cheese and breadcrumbs if using. Bake for about 20 minutes, until golden.
