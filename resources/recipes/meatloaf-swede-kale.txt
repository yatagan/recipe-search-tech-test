Meatloaf with spiced swede mash & kale
Introduction:
This dish is European in origin but has been propelled into the common consciousness as the ultimate American comfort food (that is, after the burger). Born from thrift, it has variations across almost every culture, from the Swedish meatball to the Scottish haggis.
Ingredients:
1 onion 1 garlic clove 200g minced beef 100g minced pork ½ tsp dried sage ½ tsp dried thyme 2 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tsp tomato purée 40g breadcrumbs 1 egg 1 swede 1 star anise 25g butter 200g kale 3 tbsp Doverhouse chutney salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190˚C/Gas Mark 5. Peel and finely dice the onion. Peel and finely chop/crush the garlic clove. Place them in a bowl with the beef, pork, sage, thyme, mustard, tomato purée and breadcrumbs. Beat the egg and add with a generous seasoning of salt and pepper. Mix everything together very well. Lay out a sheet of foil and brush it with some oil. Shape the mix into a rough log/loaf shape, about 20cm long. Wrap it tightly in foil to help hold the shape. Place on a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the swede and cut into 2cm cubes. Place it in a saucepan of cold salted water along with the star anise. Bring to the boil. Cook for 25-30 minutes, until soft. Wash the kale thoroughly and strip the leaves away from the stalks. Discard the stalks and roughly slice the leaves. Remove the meatloaf from the oven and pull open the foil. Return to the oven for 15 minutes to get some colour on the outside. Add the kale to the other saucepan and cook it over a medium heat for 5-8 minutes until dark, wilted and collapsed. Season with a little salt and pepper. Meanwhile, drain the swede, discarding the star anise, and return to the pan. Add the butter and mash coarsely. Season with salt and pepper. For a smoother mash you can pulse the swede in a food processor if you have one. Serve the meatloaf in thick slices with the mashed swede, a side of wilted kale and a dab of chutney.
