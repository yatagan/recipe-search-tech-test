Pork and squash stew
Introduction:
This pork stew is straightforward to cook and the results are sumptuous. It's a great way of turning a little meat into a full meal and is good eaten on its own or with brown basmati rice. Butternut has the firmest texture, but you can use any kind of squash in this recipe, and add in a few carrots or parsnips if you have them to use up. For a richer finish, add a slosh of double cream or crème fraîche towards the end of the cooking time. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 350g diced pork 1 onion or leek, finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 1 small butternut squash, peeled, deseeded & cut into large chunks 1 tsp ground cumin ½ tsp paprika ½ tsp smoked sweet paprika 1 tsp dried thyme 1 glass white wine 400g tin chopped tomatoes small handful of parsley, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan. Add the meat and brown all over then remove to a plate. Add the onion and leek and fry for a few minutes until softened, stirring every now and then to stop it catching. Add the meat back in to to the pan, with the garlic, squash and spices.Stir for 2 minutes. Add the wine and allow to bubble for a minute, then stir in the tomatoes. Half fill the tomato can with water, and add that in too. Simmer, covered, until the pork and squash chunks are tender, about an hour. Remove the lid towards the end of the cooking time if you want a thicker stew. Season, then garnish with the chopped parsley.
