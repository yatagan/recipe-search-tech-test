Savoy cabbage and sesame spring rolls
Introduction:
These crispy vegetarian spring rolls call for quite a few ingredients, but you should have most of them in your cupboards. They're very quick to prepare and fun to roll up â€“ if you're feeding a few people, employ the hands of your guests. Try dipping in sweet chilli sauce. 
Ingredients:
1 piece fresh ginger, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 fresh red chilli, finely chopped 2 tbsp vegetable oil 1 bunch spring onions, finely sliced 1 small Savoy cabbage, shredded 1 tbsp sesame seeds 100g rice vermicelli (boiled in water for 5 minutes and well drained) 1 tbsp sesame oil 1 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tbsp mirin, optional 1 handful fresh coriander, finely chopped spring roll wrappers oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower
Method:
Fry the ginger, garlic and chilli in the oil in a wok on a medium heat. Before they colour add the spring onion and cabbage and stir fry until everything starts to wilt. Add the sesame seeds and toss. Cook for a further few minutes Add the noodles and all the rest of the ingredients, apart from the wrappers. Stir really well. Wrap the mixture in the spring roll wrappers and fry gently in vegetable oil until golden brown and crispy on all sides.
