Sticky apple compôte
Introduction:
This is a refreshing, fruity filling, that makes the most of our homegrown apples. It's excellent served with warm pancakes dusted with icing sugar and lightly whipped double cream – use our basic pancake mix. Or you could eat it just with yoghurt for a sweet breakfast or dessert. 
Ingredients:
4 apples, cored & sliced or cubed ½ tsp ground cloves, allspice or cinnamon juice of 1½-2 lemons, depending on size 3 tbsp caster sugar 4 tbsp clear honey
Method:
Put all the ingredients in a saucepan and cook for 5-6 minutes until the apples are just tender.
