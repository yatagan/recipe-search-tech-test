Spicy chickpeas with roasted bunched beets and their tops
Introduction:
Crisp roasted chickpeas, tender, sweet cubes of roasted beetroot and wilted beet tops. This is a super nutritious dish that's good on it's own for a light lunch or dinner, especially topped with a dollop of yoghurt or crumbled feta and a sprinkling of chopped coriander or parsley. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch beetroot, with leaves olive oil 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed & drained ½ tsp ground cumin ½ tsp ground coriander ¼ tsp chilli powder lemon juice salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the leaves from the beetroot. Trim, wash and peel. Cut the beetroot stems into short lengths and wash them and the leaves, then leave to drain. Cut the beetroot into wedges and toss in just enough oil to coat. Season. Pat the chickpeas dry with kitchen paper. Toss on another baking tray with just enough oil to coat. Put the beetroot in the oven for about 30 minutes until tender. After the beetroot has been in the oven for 10 minutes, add the chickpeas. Remove both from the oven and toss the chickpeas in the spices. Heat a little oil in a large frying pan. Add the beetroot stems and fry for a minute or two. Add the leaves and stir to wilt. Add a good squeeze of lemon, toss in the beetroot and chickpeas and stir. Check the seasoning before serving.
