Potatoes, summer greens, wet garlic and chervil
Introduction:
A quick vegetarian dish combining plump boiled new potatoes, shredded summer greens, garlic and herbs. This is a particularly excellent accompaniment to chicken. Wet garlic looks a little like spring onions and is just young, undried garlic. It has a mild flavour so you can use a lot more. Chervil has a subtle, delicately aniseed warmth – use parsley if you can't find it. 
Ingredients:
400g potatoes, peeled & cut into 2-3 pieces, or scrubbed, halved new potatoes 300g summer greens, tough ribs cut out, leaves separated 40g butter oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower ½ stick wet garlic, shredded 1 lemon small handful fresh chervil or parsley leaves, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook potatoes in a pan of salted, boiling water for about 12 minutes, depending on size, until just tender (test by inserting a sharp knife). While the potatoes are cooking, add the summer greens to another pan of boiling water and cook for 5-7 minutes, depending on size and thickness, until tender. Drain, plunge into a bowl of cold water to refresh, then drain again. Shred the leaves. Melt a large knob of butter and a splash of oil in a frying pan. Add the wet garlic and fry for a few minutes to soften. Add the summer greens and stir for a couple of minutes to warm through (make sure they are tender, cook for a little longer if needed). Drain the potatoes and toss them into the pan. Season with salt and pepper and squeeze in a little lemon juice to taste. Toss with the chervil or parsley to serve.
