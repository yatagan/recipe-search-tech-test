One pan roast beef and roots with horseradish glaze
Introduction:
Horseradish has a natural affinity with beef and potatoes, and it's even better when it's freshly grated rather than from a jar. This recipe is a winter warmer if ever there was one. You don’t get classic roast potatoes – in fact they will end up a bit smashed, but delicious nevertheless. Use whatever root veg you have in your box – cooked in the rich juices from the beef, anything will end up tasting irresistible.
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, peeled & sliced into thirds 4 large carrots, chopped into thirds 4 large parsnips, sliced into thirds lengthways 200g beef dripping or butter 2 tbsp fresh horseradish, grated 1kg beef roast a variety of other winter veg: squash, turnips, beetroot etc., whatever you have in your vegbox salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Boil the potatoes, carrots and parsnips in plenty of salted water for 5 minutes. Drain and shake in a colander so that the edges fluff up. Melt the dripping/butter with the horseradish, plus 1 teaspoon each of sea salt and ground black pepper. Score the beef all over with a sharp knife. Layer the potatoes, carrots and parsnips plus all the vegetables in a large oven tray and place the beef on top. Ladle most of the horseradish glaze over the top of the vegetables and meat, using the remainder for basting during cooking time. Roast for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 160˚C/Gas 3 and baste the meat. Roast for about another hour, basting it every 10-15 minutes. Remove the joint, turn the veg and cook for a further 15 minutes. Allow the meat to rest under foil while the veg finish cooking.
