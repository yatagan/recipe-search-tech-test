Ribollita
Introduction:
This thick, stewy soup is filling, cheap and delicious. Savoy cabbage or chard will work if you can't get cavalo nero or kale - just reduce the cooking time a bit. The flavours will intensify if you leave this in the fridge overnight then reheat it. Omit the Parmesan to make it vegetarian. 
Ingredients:
2 garlic cloves, chopped 5-6 celery stalks, chopped 2-3 carrots, chopped 2 medium onions, chopped 2 tbsp olive oil 400g tin tomatoes 2 handfuls flat leaf parsley, chopped 1kg cavolo nero or kale, stalks removed, leaves coarsely chopped 150g cooked cannellini or borlotti beans 1 loaf stale ciabatta or other dense, chewy white bread olive oil, to finish Parmesan, grated, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
In a large saucepan gently fry garlic, celery, carrot and onion in the olive oil for about 30 minutes. Add the tomatoes and parsley and continue to cook for a further 30 minutes. Then add the cavolo or kale and half the beans, with enough liquid to cover. Simmer for 30 minutes. In a food processor, pur√©e remaining beans, and return to the soup with enough boiling water to make the soup liquid. Add the torn up bread, a generous amount of good olive oil and season. Serve with grated Parmesan.
