Swede, leek and apple bake
Introduction:
This super-simple vegetarian bake makes an excellent midweek, cold weather dish. You could eat it as a main with cabbage or other greens on the side, or it goes beautifully with all things porky – sausages, a roast, pork chops... 
Ingredients:
25g butter, plus extra for greasing 2 leeks, finely shredded 4 large sage leaves 75ml white wine or apple juice 1 swede (800g-1kg unpeeled weight), peeled, cut in half lengthways, then very finely sliced 2 apples, cored, halved & thinly sliced 50g Cheddar, grated
Method:
Preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Melt the butter in a large frying pan and fry the leeks on a very low heat for 12 minutes, stirring now and then. Add the sage and wine or juice. Cook for 2 minutes. Season. Layer the swede, apple and leeks in a baking dish, finishing with swede. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil, sprinkle with cheese and bake for 15 minutes until golden.
