Squash and lentil soup with chilli and fennel seeds
Introduction:
Sweet squash and sturdy lentils make for a lively vegetarian soup â€“ a lunch or dinner designed to keep out the cold. This easy-to-make, chunky soup is substantial enough to be eaten on its own, although a hunk of bread is always a nice addition. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 dried chillies, finely chopped 1 tbsp ground fennel seeds 200g green lentils 1 medium squash, peeled, deseeded & cut into 1cm cubes salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the olive oil in a large pan, add the onion, garlic, chillies and ground fennel seeds and sweat gently for about 5 minutes. Add the lentils and the diced squash. Cover with water and simmer for about 40 minutes until both the squash and lentils are tender. Season to taste. The soup can be served like this, or you can blend a cupful of the soup and stir it back into the pan.
