Venison and red wine casserole
Introduction:
This succulent, slow-cooked dish is very easy to get in the pan and bakes down to beautiful, unguent tenderness. Eat it with a heap of buttery celeriac mash, cabbage and a further helping of redcurrant jelly. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp plain flour 900g diced venison oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 large onion, finely sliced 3 carrots, peeled & finely diced 3 sticks celery, diced 3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 450ml red wine 200ml beef stock 10g dried wild mushrooms, chopped (optional) 2 tbsp redcurrant jelly 1 tsp balsamic vinegar 10-12 juniper berries, lightly crushed a few sprigs fresh thyme & rosemary 2 bay leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Place the flour in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Toss the venison in the flour to coat. In a large flameproof casserole heat 3 tablespoons oil. Fry the venison in batches to brown; you want a good caramel colour for the best flavour, so don’t crowd the pan. Once browned, transfer the venison to a large bowl and set aside. Heat a little more oil in the pan and fry the onion, carrots, celery and garlic for a few minutes to soften. Add the wine, stock, dried mushrooms, redcurrant jelly, balsamic vinegar, juniper berries and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Return the venison to the pan and bring to the boil. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 2½-3 hours, until the meat is tender.
