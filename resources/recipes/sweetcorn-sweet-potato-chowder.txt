Sweetcorn and sweet potato chowder with crispy tortillas
Introduction:
The wonderful smoky sweet taste of this corn chowder is out of all proportion to the little time it takes to make. You can add anything from smoked fish to crab, but this is a hearty meal on its own with oven-warmed tortillas topped with melting cheese and spice. There's no cream used here so this is good for vegans and those eating dairy-free if you omit the cheese on the tortillas. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp oil for frying e.g. sunflower 1 leek, finely sliced (or use an onion) 2 garlic cloves, crushed 500g sweet potatoes, peeled & diced 1 red pepper, deseeded & diced 1 red chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tsp paprika 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves 2 bay leaves 1.2 litres veg stock 2 large cobs sweetcorn, kernels cut off 1 lime 8 soft corn tortillas 50g Cheddar or Double Gloucester, grated 1 tsp paprika or ground cumin small handful fresh chives, chopped (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Fry the leek for 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the sweet potato, pepper, chilli, paprika, thyme, bay leaf and stir for 1 minute. Pour in the stock. Season. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes. Add the sweetcorn and simmer for 5 more minutes, or until the potato and corn are tender. Blitz in a food processor, then return to the pan and reheat gently if necessary. Add a good squeeze of lime juice and check the seasoning. While the chowder is simmering, heat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut the tortillas into quarters and lay on a baking sheet. Sprinkle over the cheese, a little sea salt and the paprika or cumin. Bake for 6-8 minutes, keeping an eye on them so they don’t burn, until crispy and golden. Remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly, then serve with the chowder, sprinkled with chives.
