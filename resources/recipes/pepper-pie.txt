Pepper pie
Introduction:
Our peppers are in season in the UK for a mere two months - September and October. This is a delicious, warming way of turning them into dinner and it's just as good cold as it is hot. 
Ingredients:
2 peppers 125g curd cheese 4 eggs, beaten 30ml fresh parsley, chopped 15ml thyme, chopped 25g butter 1 onion, thinly sliced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 200g shortcrust pastry
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Char the peppers over a flame and skin them. Core, de-seed them and chop the flesh. Put the cheese in a bowl and mix in the eggs, peppers, parsley and thyme. Melt the butter, stir in the onion and garlic and cook until golden. Mix them into the cheese, eggs and peppers. Season Use two thirds of the pastry to line the pie plate. Pour in the filling, and use the pastry that is left over to cover the top. Seal the edges and brush with beaten egg or milk. Bake for 30 minutes until top is golden brown.
