Turkey quesadillas
Introduction:
A post-Christmas version of a great, family-friendly Mexican dish in between a stuffed pancake and a toasted sandwich. This is a delicious, easy and almost instant meal that's great for transforming leftover turkey. 
Ingredients:
1 small to medium-sized butternut squash, peeled & diced 1 red pepper, diced 1 red or white onion, finely diced ¼ tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground cumin ¼ tsp paprika 1-2 fresh chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 2 tbsp olive oil leftover turkey, chopped into bite-sized pieces 4 large flour tortillas a little olive oil for brushing 200g Cheddar, grated large handful fresh coriander salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190'C/Gas 5. Toss the squash, pepper, corn, onion, spices, chilli and olive oil in a large baking dish. Season. Roast in the oven for 30-35 minutes, until the squash is tender. Add the leftover turkey after 25 minutes so it can warm through. Brush each tortilla on one side with a little oil. Put one of the tortillas in a large non-stick frying pan, oil side down. Sprinkle some cheese over one half of the tortilla, then the veg mixture, then a few coriander leaves. Fold the other half of the tortilla over to make a half circle, gently pressing down with your hands to flatten. Gently cook for a minute or two, until the tortilla is crisp and golden brown (keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn). Carefully turn over using a large fish slice and cook on the other side. Keep warm in a low oven while you repeat with the others. Cut each one in half to serve.
