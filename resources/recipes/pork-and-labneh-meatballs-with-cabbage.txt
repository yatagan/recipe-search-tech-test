Pork and labneh meatballs with cabbage
Introduction:
A nice alternative to the more traditional meatballs in tomato sauce. 
Ingredients:
500g pork mince 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 medium onion, peeled, ½ coarsely grated & ½ finely diced 1 tsp caraway seeds, toasted & coarsely ground ¼ preserved lemon, finely chopped ½ lemon, juiced 100g labneh 100g fresh white breadcrumbs 3 tbsp olive oil 500ml chicken stock 2 small Savoy cabbages, trimmed, most of stalk removed & each cut into 6 wedges 80ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas Mark 4. Mix the pork, garlic, grated onion, caraway, lemon, labneh and breadcrumbs and season well. Form into meatballs about 3cm in diameter. Lay out the meatballs on a large, oiled baking tray and bake for 10 minutes. Leave the oven on, and carefully remove the meatballs and set aside. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the cabbage wedges and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and dry on a clean kitchen towel. Put a little olive oil and salt in a mixing bowl, add the cabbage and gently toss until the cabbage is well coated. Next, fry the diced onion until soft in a sauté pan. Add the chicken stock and lemon juice and reduce until it’s noticeably thickening. Stir in the cream and add the meatballs. Carefully stir and cook gently with the lid on for 10 minutes. While the meatballs are cooking, switch the oven up to 220°C/Gas Mark 7, re-oil the baking tray and lay out the drained cabbage wedges. Roast for 10 minutes until the outer leaves are beginning to brown. Serve with rice.
