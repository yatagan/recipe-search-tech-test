Slow roast leg of lamb 
Introduction:
Slow roasted, melt-in-your-mouth lamb. Start by taking the joint out of the fridge and bringing it up to room temperature before putting in the oven - 30 minutes should do the trick. Try to use a flameproof roasting pan if you have one – it makes gravy-making easier. Eat with roast potatoes and mint sauce for a traditional Sunday dinner. 
Ingredients:
For the lamb: 1.8kg leg of lamb small sprigs rosemary a few garlic cloves, left whole salt & pepper For the gravy: 2 tbsp plain flour 200ml red wine 1 tsp redcurrant jelly 300ml stock For the mint sauce: large handful fresh mint, leaves chopped 2 tbsp sugar 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Prepare the lamb: Cut several slits in the skin of the lamb, just large enough to poke in a clove of garlic and a small piece of rosemary in each. Season the lamb well with salt and pepper. Place the prepared lamb in a snug fitting roasting pan and cover with foil. Roast for 3½ hours, basting every 30 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for another 30 minutes to brown the skin a little. Slow roasting doesn’t require the meat to be rested at the end as it will be very tender and will shred apart with a fork. It will shrink up as it cooks, so if you’re serving more than 6 or want leftovers, you might want to stick to the traditional roasting method. For the gravy: Once the lamb is removed from the pan, skim off most of the fat from the remaining juices. Place the pan on the hob (make sure it’s a flameproof pan, or decant the juices into one) and stir in the flour. Stir for a couple of minutes to cook the flour. Add the wine and redcurrant jelly. Stir for 1 minute, then add the stock. Simmer for a few minutes. For the mint sauce: Put the mint in a heatproof bowl with the sugar and 2 tablespoons of boiling water. Leave to cool, then stir in the white wine vinegar. Leave to steep for an hour or so if you can.
