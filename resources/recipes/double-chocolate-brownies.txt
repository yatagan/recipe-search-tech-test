Double chocolate brownies
Introduction:
The trick with these brownies is not to overcook them – they should be springy on the outside and moist and squidgy inside. These'll keep for a week or so in an airtight container or for a month in the freezer. Try adding chopped nuts – walnuts are especially good – or dried fruit to the basic mix. 
Ingredients:
180g butter 110g cocoa powder 300g caster sugar seeds from 1 vanilla pod 4 large eggs 100g plain flour ¾ tsp baking powder pinch of salt 120g dark chocolate, finely chopped
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Melt the butter in a pan and mix in the cocoa powder. Add the caster sugar, vanilla seeds and eggs. Mix together. Add in the plain flour, baking powder, salt and dark chocolate. The chocolate will partially melt into the mixture. Don’t worry if some bits don’t melt completely. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes until slightly crisp on the outside but still nice and squidgy in the middle.
