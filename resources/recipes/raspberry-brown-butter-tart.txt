Raspberry brown butter tart
Introduction:
This is delectable tart is a good way of turning a small amount of raspberries into a dessert to feed 8. The brown butter gives a nuttiness to the filling. It works equally well with blackberries, blueberries, poached pears or even figs. If you'd like to save time, you could also start with shop-bought pastry. 
Ingredients:
for the pastry: 175g plain flour 60g icing sugar 125g unsalted butter, cut up 2 medium egg yolks for the filling: 3 eggs 300g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely grated orange zest 60g plain flour 175g unsalted butter 1 vanilla pod, split & scraped 200g raspberries icing sugar, for dusting
Method:
First make the pastry. Put the flour and icing sugar in a food processor and mix briefly. Add the butter and pulse until the consistency resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolks and pulse until the pastry comes together. Wrap in cling film and leave in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about 2mm thick, then use to line a 28cm loose-bottomed flan tin, pushing the pastry up the sides so it comes slightly above the top of the tin. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Line the base and sides of the pastry with a piece of baking parchment and fill with baking beans or rice. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the paper and beans and bake for another 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside. To make the filling, put the eggs, sugar and orange zest in a bowl and whisk until well combined. Sift in the flour and whisk to combine. Heat the butter and vanilla in a pan until the butter foams and goes dark brown. Whisk it into the egg mixture. Remove the vanilla pod. Sprinkle the raspberries over the base of the pastry case, pour the butter mixture over the fruit and bake for about 40 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the filling is just set. Leave to cool to room temperature, then dust with icing sugar and serve.
