Roasted Brussels sprouts and caramelised onions
Introduction:
Roasting Brussels sprouts intensifies their flavour and averts any risk of sogginess. They pair beautifully with meltingly sweet slow-caramelised onions. If you're not a vegetarian, a bit of crispy, salty pancetta or bacon completes the picture. Use any leftover onions to serve with soup, on bruschetta topped with some goat's cheese, or with pork or steak. 
Ingredients:
3 tsp olive oil large knob butter 3 large onions 2 tsp salt 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp balsamic vinegar 500g Brussels sprouts, washed & trimmed, cut in ½ if large 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
In a large heavy bottomed pan heat the oil and butter until melted. Add the onion and cook for 10 minutes. Add the salt and sugar, lower the heat and cook for 30 minutes to 1 hour – leave the onions for a few minutes at a time, then stir occasionally to prevent them sticking to the bottom. Add a little more oil if they look like burning. The onion should gradually turn a dark brown colour – it is important not to stir too much to allow the onions time to caramelise. Once cooked add a splash of balsamic vinegar at the end to deglaze the pan. For the sprouts, preheat oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Toss the Brussels sprouts in oil to coat and place on a baking tray. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, shaking every once in a while to turn the sprouts so they brown evenly. Insert a knife into one to check they are cooked. Toss a couple of large spoonfuls of caramelised onions with the sprouts and serve with some chopped fresh parsley.
