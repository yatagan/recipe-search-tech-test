Roasted oca
Introduction:
Oca can be cooked in many ways; roasted, mashed or fried. It loses its bright pink colour and a little of its zesty flavour, but retains enough to be interesting. Imagine something akin to a lighter, sharper tasting potato, or if you’ve eaten them, a Jerusalem artichoke in texture (without the windy after effect), and you’re on the right track.
Ingredients:
200g oca, washed well, left unpeeled oil for roasting, e.g. light olive, sunflower or rapeseed salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Cut any large oca into chunks so they’re all roughly the same size. Toss in just enough oil to coat and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes for very small ones, 20-25 minutes or so for larger oca, until just tender when pierced with a knife.
