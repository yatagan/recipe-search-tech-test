Sicilian cauliflower salad
Introduction:
Simply dressed with good olive oil and lemon juice, this light and healthy recipe is a good way of getting the best of cauliflower. It's important not to overcook the veg so that it remains crunchy. This makes a great, very healthy midweek meal â€“ and, because it gets even better when left to sit for a few hours, it would be lovely to take any leftovers in your packed lunch. 
Ingredients:
1 red pepper 1 cauliflower, broken into florets 12 black olives, pitted 4 anchovies, chopped 2 tbsp capers 4 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp lemon juice fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Char the pepper under the grill or over a gas flame and leave to cool in a plastic bag or container before peeling and slicing. Blanch the cauliflower florets in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes and drain thoroughly (or steam for 3-4 minutes). While still warm, toss with the pepper, olives, anchovies and capers, then mix in the olive oil and lemon juice. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and chill for several hours before serving.
