Turnips and sugar snap peas
Introduction:
This surprising but very successful combination of mild turnips and sweet sugar snaps goes well as a side to a roast dinner. It's especially good with pork. There's no need to be at all exact about the proportions of the veg â€“ use more sugar snaps if you'd like a lighter, greener dish. 
Ingredients:
1 bunch turnips, washed, peeled, trimmed & cut in half or quarters if large 100g sugar snap peas, trimmed & stems removed 25g butter splash olive oil 2 tsp breadcrumbs 1 bunched onion, chopped 1 tsp lemon zest 2 tsp fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Put the turnips in a pan of boiling water and cook for about 8-10 minutes or until just tender. Remove and leave to drain. Blanch the peas in the same water for 2 minutes, remove and drain. In a heavy based frying pan, heat the butter and oil and toss the turnips and peas over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes. Add the breadcrumbs and onion and toss for another minute or two until the breadcrumbs have browned. Add the coriander and lemon zest, and season to taste.
