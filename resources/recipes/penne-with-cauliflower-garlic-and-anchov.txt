Penne with cauliflower, garlic and anchovies
Introduction:
The anchovy taste mellows as they melt into the oil, but if you don't like anchovies, substitute capers instead. Don't waste the flavour-infused oil in the anchovy tin â€“ cook the garlic in it. This recipe also works well with broccoli, especially purple sprouting. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, divided into florets 250g penne 4 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 5 anchovy fillets pinch cayenne pepper 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the cauliflower florets in boiling salted water for about 5 minutes, then drain and set aside. Cook the penne in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a separate pan, add the garlic and cook until softened but not browned. Remove from the heat, add the anchovy fillets and stir and mash them into the oil until dissolved. Add the cauliflower florets and cayenne, mix well to coat the cauliflower in the anchovy oil, then return to a low heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, then mash the cauliflower roughly with a fork. Drain the pasta and mix with the cauliflower. Season to taste, sprinkle over the chopped parsley, then serve.
