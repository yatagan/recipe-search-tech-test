Kale and chorizo soup
Introduction:
Inspired by the Portuguese favourite, caldo verde, this rustic stew makes a cheap and tasty weeknight dinner. It gets even better if cooked a couple of hours or even a day beforehand, so the chorizo has time to infuse the broth. Chorizo sausage is available from Riverford, made in our kitchens. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, diced 600g chorizo sausage, thickly sliced 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1kg potatoes, peeled & diced 200g kale, washed & stems removed 1 litre chicken stock salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oil and cook the onion and sausage over a low heat for about 20 minutes until soft. Stir in the garlic and potatoes and cook for a further 10 minutes Roughly chop the kale leaves and cover with the stock. Simmer for 30 minutes adding more stock to keep everything covered. Season to taste and serve with crusty bread.
