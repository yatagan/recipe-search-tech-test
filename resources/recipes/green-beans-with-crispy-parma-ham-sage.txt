Green beans with crispy Parma ham and sage
Introduction:
Sage is a classic companion to anything porky – and is particularly good sizzled with Parma ham and fresh green beans. Throw in some boiled new potatoes and this is a quick light meal on its own. It's also good with more porkiness – try a grilled fillet, or thin slices of flash-fried pig liver. 
Ingredients:
250g green or flat beans, trimmed & cut diagonally into 2-3 cm lengths 1 tbsp olive oil 6 slices Parma ham, cut or torn into short thin strips 10 sage leaves a few drops of balsamic vinegar (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Steam the beans until just tender. Run under cold water to stop the cooking, drain and reserve. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Carefully fry the ham strips and sage until the ham is crispy. Remove the ham and sage to a separate plate but leave the oil in the pan. Reheat the pan and turn the beans in the oil until they are hot and starting to fry. Shake over the balsamic vinegar, if using, and add salt and pepper. Turn beans onto serving plate, scatter over the ham and sage and serve.
