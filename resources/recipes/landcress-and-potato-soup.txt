Landcress and potato soup
Introduction:
Landcress (also called American cress) has a strong peppery flavour, stronger than watercress, that needs some dilution with milder leaves to make a salad for most palates. It also makes a terrific, punchy soup. Don't substitute watercress here. 
Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped 340g potatoes, peeled & chopped 55g butter 100g landcress 850ml vegetable or chicken stock 280ml milk 100ml double cream salt & pepper
Method:
Gently sweat the onion and potato in the butter in a covered pan for 5 minutes. Add the landcress and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the stock and simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are cooked. Add the milk and cream and liquidise. Do not whizz excessively or the potatoes will give a glutinous texture. Season to taste. Serve with a few small leaves and a swirl of cream if you are feeling artistic.
