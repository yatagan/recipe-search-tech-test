Easy apple crumble
Introduction:
We use demerara sugar in this classic apple crumble as it gives the topping a nice crunch, but you can use light brown or golden granulated sugar if that’s what you have. The apple juice is not essential, but ensures the filling is nice and juicy (and extra apple-y!). Make sure your butter is cold from the fridge, to give a good texture. This is a generous crumble amount, for a nice thick layer. If you don’t use quite all of it, it can be frozen for later use. Or make a mini crumble with some leftovers from your fruit bowl – bananas, oranges, plums, pears are all good. 
Ingredients:
For the filling: 1kg dessert apples (unpeeled weight) a good pinch of ground cinnamon – ⅛ tsp, if you’re keen on exact measurements, or use allspice 50g sugar – use what you have; golden caster, granulated, or light brown all work ¼ coffee mug of apple juice (optional) For the topping; 250g plain flour 125g cold unsalted butter 125g demerara sugar 50g dried oats
Method:
Preheat your oven to 180˚C/Gas 4. Peel and quarter the apples, cut out the core then cut each quarter into 3-4 pieces. Toss in a baking dish with the cinnamon, sugar and apple juice if using. Press it all down a little, then set aside while you make the topping. Dice the butter – approx. 1cm cubes. Pulse the butter and flour together in a food processor until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs; don’t overwork it and make it too fine, some lumps are good. Alternatively, rub the butter and flour together with your fingertips in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar and oats. Spread the mixture over the filling to cover it well and give it a thick layer of crumble to your liking, then lightly press it down – you don’t want it too flat though, so you get a little uneven colour as it bakes. Bake for approx. 45 mins or so, keeping an eye on it towards the end, until the topping is golden to your liking, and the filling soft. Serve with your favourite accompaniment – custard, cream or ice-cream.
