Roast paprika potato wedges with crème fraîche and chives
Introduction:
There are few better ways to begin a meal than with this moreish pairing of crisp, smoky oven-baked potato wedges dipped in a bowl of chive and garlic-infused crème fraîche. This is a good party food or comfort food for a chilly autumn family evening. It also works with sweet potatoes. 
Ingredients:
1kg potatoes, scrubbed clean & cut into wedges oil for roasting e.g. sunflower, rapeseed or light olive 1 tsp paprika ¼ tsp smoked paprika 15g fresh chives, finely chopped or snipped 1 garlic clove, finely chopped, crushed or grated 250g crème fraîche, or thick Greek yoghurt salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220˚C/Gas Mark 8. Toss the potato wedges in a baking dish in just enough oil to coat. Sprinkle over the smoked and plain paprika, toss again, and season well with salt and pepper. Bake for 40-45 minutes, turning them once halfway through, until tender and golden brown. Stir the garlic and chives into the crème fraîche. Add a pinch of salt and lemon juice to taste. Serve the wedges dipped into crème fraîche.
