Tomato and feta salad
Introduction:
This is a simplified version of a Greek salad that's best made with very ripe tomatoes. To make it more of a complete meal, add cucumber, peppers and a squeeze of lemon. Eat with grilled pitta or ciabatta to soak up the juices. For a less traditional twist, try this with mozzarella. 
Ingredients:
750g tomatoes 200g feta cheese 12 black olives, stones removed 100ml olive oil few fresh fresh basil leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Slice the tomatoes and arrange on a serving plate or dish. Crumble over the feta cheese. Chop the olives into halves or slices and scatter over the tomatoes. Drizzle the olive oil on top and season with salt & pepper. Tear the basil leaves into strips and sprinkle over the salad. Serve at room temperature.
