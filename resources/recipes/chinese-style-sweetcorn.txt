Chinese style sweetcorn
Introduction:
This Asian flavour combination makes a great light dinner stir-fried with spinach and eaten mixed into a bowl of noodles. It also works well as a starter, or as a side to chicken that's been marinaded in soy sauce, honey, sesame oil and minced ginger and garlic. 
Ingredients:
2-4 cobs of corn 2 tbsp sesame oil 1 tbsp soy sauce 1cm piece fresh ginger, peeled & grated 1 large garlic clove, crushed 5 spring onions, cut into 1cm lengths
Method:
Remove the outer leaves of the cobs and wash in water. Cut the corn from the cob carefully with a knife, as close to the base as possible. This will leave you with the corn itself that may need a second wash. Heat the oil in a saucepan and saut√© the corn. When heated through, add the soy sauce, ginger and garlic and stir well. Add the spring onions and cook for a further 4 minutes, stirring thoroughly. Serve immediately.
