Grilled aubergine salad
Introduction:
A very simple dish of dressed aubergines. The grilling imparts a wonderful smokiness. The aubergines could be tossed with feta, tomatoes, couscous and mint for a light vegetarian meal. They're also a good cold side to go with grilled meat or fish. 
Ingredients:
1Â½ tbsp white or red wine vinegar 1-2 garlic cloves, crushed 7 tbsp olive oil 2 large aubergines 2-3 tbsp mixed herbs-fresh parsley, basil or chives, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
To make the dressing, mix the vinegar with the garlic, pepper and a little salt. Whisk in the olive oil a tablespoon at a time. Slice the aubergine into 1cm thick discs. Sprinkle lightly with salt and leave for 30 minutes-1 hour. Wipe dry. Toss with half the dressing. Grill, close to the heat, until browned on both sides. Toss with enough of the remaining dressing to moisten, then leave to cool. Toss with the chopped herbs and serve.
