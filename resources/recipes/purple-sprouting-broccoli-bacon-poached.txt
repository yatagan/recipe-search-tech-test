Purple sprouting broccoli, bacon and poached egg on toast
Introduction:
A simple start to the day and equally as good without the bacon. The yolk must be runny and the bread must be good and toothsome. 
Ingredients:
splash white wine vinegar 6 streaky bacon rashers 2 thick slices good bread 150g purple sprouting broccoli, cut into small florets 15g butter 2 eggs salt & pepper
Method:
Set a pan of salted water to boil, adding a splash of white wine vinegar. Fry the bacon in a pan until crispy. Put your bread in the toaster. Turn the water down to the faintest of simmers, gently crack your eggs into the pan. Add the purple sprouting broccoli to the bacon in the frying pan, add the butter and gently fry until just tender. After 3-4 minutes gently remove the eggs, you want the white to be cooked and the yolk to be runny. Soak up the buttery bacony juices by pressing the toast into the frying pan. Stack the purple sprouting broccoli and bacon on top of the bread. Finish with the poached eggs, a pinch of sea salt and a twist of pepper
