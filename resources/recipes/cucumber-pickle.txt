Cucumber pickle
Introduction:
'This recipe is from my mother, Gillian Watson. We used to have it on family picnics in sandwiches or pittas with cream cheese. It is good with a strong, hard cheese or with terrines and cold meats, especially ham.' (Guy Watson) This is easy to make as pickles go - just be sure the cucumbers are good and fresh, and leave plenty of time to salt the cucumbers and onions. It should be stored in the fridge once opened. Makes 2-2.5kg. 
Ingredients:
5 cucumbers 1kg onions, halved about 80g sea salt (or cooking salt) 500ml distilled malt vinegar 350g granulated sugar (or soft brown) 4 tsp mustard seeds generous ½ tsp ground cloves (or use a few whole cloves instead) generous ½ tsp ground turmeric
Method:
Slice the cucumbers and onions very thinly (a mandolin is ideal for this). Layer them in a bowl, sprinkling with the sea salt as you go, then weigh them down with a plate and leave for a few hours or overnight. Drain off the liquid, rinse the vegetables well and drain in a colander. Combine the vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, cloves and turmeric in a pan and bring slowly to the boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the well-drained cucumber and onion mixture and bring back to the boil for 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to sterilised jars, using a slotted spoon. Bring the liquid back to the boil and simmer until slightly reduced for about 15 minutes, then divide it between the jars, filling to the brim. Put on the lids and label. The pickle will keep for several months.
