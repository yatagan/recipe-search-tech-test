Preheat oven to 200ºC/Gas Mark 6. To make the herb butter, combine the Stilton and butter and chill.

Season well with salt and freshly ground pepper and put the pork pork shoulder steaks steaks on top. Brush over the remaining oil and season again with salt and pepper. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the pork is lightly golden. Reduce the oven temperature to 190°C/Gas 5, remove the steaks, turn the pears and onions over and sprinkle with the brown sugar.
