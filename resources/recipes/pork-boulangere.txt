Pork boulangère
Introduction:
This is the perfect simple late Sunday lunch. You can put it in the oven, go out and do whatever business you have to do on a Sunday and come back and eat. It’s almost as though someone has cooked it for you. 
Ingredients:
3 onions, thinly sliced 6 large waxy potatoes, peeled & thinly sliced small bunch thyme, leaves picked small bunch sage, leaves chopped 800g/1.3kg pork shoulder 1 garlic bulb, separated into cloves, peeled & halved lengthways 600ml chicken stock
Method:
Preheat oven to 130°C/Gas Mark ¾. Combine the onions, potatoes, thyme leaves and sage in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Layer the onions and potatoes in a roasting tray and lay the shoulder of pork on top, skin-side up. Pierce the pork through the rind and push a clove of garlic into each hole. Pour the chicken pork shoulder roast stock into the tray and place in the oven. Roast the pork for 3-4 hours for the 800g joint and 4–5 hours for the 1.3kg joint, until tender and the potatoes are cooked through. Remove the tray from the oven, peel/cut off the crackling, cover with foil and leave the pork to rest for 20 minutes before carving. Grill the crackling under a medium heat until it blisters before serving.
