Courgette, apple & kale juice
Introduction:
Courgette is mild, clean, and yields plenty of juice. Kale is more intense and concentrated. Apple acts as a fulcrum to balance the two. Vivid, verdant and vital. This should yield about 300ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order to plunge. 
Ingredients:
100g kale 2 apples 2 courgettes 1 lime
Method:
Juice the kale, apples and courgettes. Taste and adjust with a squeeze or 2 of lime. Drink it.
