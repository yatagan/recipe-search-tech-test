Easy ideas for spinach and chard
Introduction:
Both dark leafy veg loaded with nutrients, spinach and chard can often be substituted for each other in recipes, though chard takes slightly longer to cook. Wash them thoroughly to get rid of any grit. They team well with lamb, chilli, garlic, lemon and tomato.

Cook simply: Stir leaves into soups, stews or curries for a couple of minutes before the end of cooking.

Stir fry in 2 tablespoons sunflower or groundnut oil, with a small piece of grated ginger, 2 cloves finely sliced garlic and a pinch of dried chilli flakes or a chopped fresh chilli.
