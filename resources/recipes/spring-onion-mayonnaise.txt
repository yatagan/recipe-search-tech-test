Spring onion mayonnaise
Introduction:
This was originally served in Louisiana in oyster po'boys – a baguette stuffed with deep-fried oysters, crisp lettuce and mayo. If you don't want to stretch to that, it also works in all the places you'd normally enjoy mayonnaise, like in a good potato salad. 
Ingredients:
½ garlic clove, crushed 2 spring onions, finely chopped a little green chilli 200ml mayonnaise
Method:
Spring-onion mayonnaise is easily made by blending crushed garlic, finely chopped spring onions and a little green chilli with mayonnaise.
