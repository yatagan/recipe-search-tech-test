Pear and almond tart
Introduction:
This is a French classic: pears in almond cream encased in a golden, crisp shell. It's perfect slightly soft and warm from the oven, but also at room temperature when it's had a chance to firm up a bit. You could also use poached quinces in place of the pears. 
Ingredients:
shortcrust pastry 4 pears, peeled & cut into segments 260g butter 260g sugar 260g flaked almonds 3 eggs vanilla essence slosh of brandy or amaretto
Method:
Preheat oven to 160Â°C/Gas 3. Bake shortcrust pastry case blind. Arrange peeled pear pieces around the case. Soften butter and mix with sugar in a food processor. Add the flaked almonds and blitz for 10 seconds. Add 1 egg, blitz again, doing the same with the other 2 eggs. Add vanilla and booze and process for another 20 seconds. Spread mix over pears in tart case and bake for about 45 minutes, until firm. Serve with cream.
