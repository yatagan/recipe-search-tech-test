Hot chicken wings
Introduction:
Crispy, spicy oven-baked chicken wings. These are great with drinks, or with steamed or boiled jasmine rice for an easy and inexpensive weekday supper. Prepare the night before to let the flavours in the marinade infuse. 
Ingredients:
1kg chicken wings for the marinade: 1 tbsp groundnut oil 1 tbsp sesame oil 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp dry sherry or mirin 1 tbsp honey 1 tbsp hoisin sauce 3cm cube fresh ginger, grated 1 red chilli, halved & sliced thinly 2 garlic cloves, crushed & finely chopped to serve: 1 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped spring onion, finely slice 1 lemon, cut into wedges salt & pepper
Method:
Remove the wing tips and discard (or use for stock making). Make the marinade: Mix together all the ingredients in a large bowl, (de-seed the chilli if you don't like heat) add salt and pepper, and turn the wings in it to coat. Cover with cling film and refrigerate overnight. Turn all again. Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Spread the wings over the surface of a large oven tray so they're not crowded and cook for 30 minutes, turning once during that time to ensure even browning all over. Leave the wings to rest for 5 minutes. To serve toss the wings in chopped coriander and thinly sliced spring onion before serving with lemon wedges.
