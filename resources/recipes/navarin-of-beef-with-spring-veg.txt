Navarin of beef with spring veg
Introduction:
Diced beef and primavera vegetables don’t exactly go hand in hand, but as we’re on a bit of a new potato theme one option would be to swap lamb for beef in a spring navarin casserole. The vegetables, particularly the potatoes and turnips, are the stars of the show, so using less meat is almost an improvement. Other vegetables (asparagus, greens etc) can be added about 15 minutes before serving.
Ingredients:
500g diced beef 25g butter 1 tbsp plain flour 1 tbsp tomato purée about 1 litre chicken (or veg) stock 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tsp sugar 1 bouquet garni (a sprig of rosemary, thyme & a bay leaf, tied together) 8 new potatoes, scrubbed & halved 8 carrots, scrubbed, halved if large 8 small onions or shallots, or 2 large onions, cut into quarters 5 turnips, peeled & cut into quarters (or left whole if they are very small) 200g peas 200g broad beans 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Sprinkle the beef with salt and pepper and leave for 1 hour. Heat the butter in a large, heavy-based pan, add the beef (in batches if necessary) and cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until browned all over. Add the flour and cook, stirring, over a low heat for about 4 minutes. Add the tomato purée and then gradually stir in half the stock until you have a smooth sauce. Add the garlic, sugar and bouquet garni, plus enough of the remaining stock just to cover the beef. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for an hour. Add the root vegetables and onions and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, until tender. Skim off any surface fat, season to taste and add the peas, and the broad beans, if using. Simmer for 5 minutes, then scatter with the parsley and serve.
