Pasta with purple sprouting broccoli and goat's cheese
Introduction:
This vegetarian pasta is a great last-minuter. You can cook the broccoli and toast the nuts in the time it takes for the pasta to cook. Add in some crisp lardons of smoked bacon as well as, or instead of the walnuts. Use Pecorino rather than Parmesan if you're vegetarian. If you haven't got PSB, normal broccoli is fine to use. 
Ingredients:
100g walnuts (optional) 1 broccoli head, cut into florets 400g tagliatelle pasta 2 tbsp olive oil 3 garlic cloves, crushed 75ml crème fraîche, cream or mascarpone 2 tbsp Parmesan or Pecorino, finely grated 150g soft goat’s cheese 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped, to serve salt & pepper
Method:
If you’re using walnuts, either dry fry in a heavy frying pan, or toast on a baking sheet until very lightly browned, then roughly chop and set aside. Cook the broccoli in a large pan of salted boiling water until just tender. Scoop it out using a slotted spoon and refresh under the cold tap for a couple of minutes. Add the pasta to this water and cook according to the packet instructions. Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and fry over a low heat for a minute. Add the mascarpone and the Parmesan. When warm, mix with the pasta and broccoli, crumble in the goat’s cheese and parsley, and season well. Serve with the walnuts if using.
