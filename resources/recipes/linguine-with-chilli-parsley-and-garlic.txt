Linguine with chilli, parsley and garlic (alio Olio)
Introduction:
Pasta with garlic, oil and chilli (Aglio olio peperoncino) is also known as the 'cook's emergency dish', because it's made in a jiffy and out of the store cupboard. Tossed with plenty of parsley, this is a favourite summer lunch. Its clean, simple taste is a great tonic for a jaded palate. 
Ingredients:
350g linguine (or spaghetti) 2 tbsp olive oil 2 red chillies, deseeded & finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped pinch dried chilli flakes 2-3 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a medium pan, add the red chillies and cook gently for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, being careful not to let it brown. Add the dried chilli flakes and parsley and remove from the heat. Drain the pasta and add to the chilli, parsley and garlic, mixing well over a low heat. Season to taste and serve at once.
