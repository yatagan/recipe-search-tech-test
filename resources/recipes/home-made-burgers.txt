Home-made burgers
Introduction:
Riverford minced beef makes excellent burgers, but many aficionados call for chuck steak which has a good fat content. If you want to use that instead, finely dice it then pulse to the right texture in a food processor. Make this your own with your favouite toppings: lettuce leaves, sliced tomatoes, slivers of red onion, gherkins, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise. 
Ingredients:
100g onions, finely chopped 1kg minced beef 8g salt 2g pepper
Method:
Gently fry the onions in 2 tablespoons of oil for 10 mins, until softened without colouring. Cool. Combine the minced meat and cooked onions. Season. Test a little of the mix to check it has the right amount of seasoning for you by frying a small, walnut-sized nugget of it until just cooked through. Taste that and adjust the seasoning if needed. Form the rest of the mix into burger shapes. Grill, barbecue or fry the burgers until just cooked through.
