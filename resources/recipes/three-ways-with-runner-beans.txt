Runner beans three ways
Introduction:

Ingredients:
runner beans
Method:
Sliced & dressed: Clean & de-string the beans with a peeler. Slice finely at an angle and blanch for 3-4 mins until just cooked. Throw with a simple vinaigrette, salsa verde or pesto. For a bit of luxury, add a blob of clotted cream to the just cooked beans and top with toasted almonds. Slow cooked: Try cooking roughly sliced into a rich tomato sauce for the best part of an hour until melting and tender; makes a perfect pasta sauce with a few anchovies or capers chopped through. Salads: They are delicious thrown through late summer salads, either lightly blanched or peeled raw into long, curly and crunchy strips.
