Courgette relish
Introduction:
This lovely relish is a good way of using up a glut. Leave it to mature for at least a day – preferably longer – before eating. It's great for the barbecue season, slapped on a burger, or with cold slices of ham, or strong cheese, or sausages. 
Ingredients:
500g courgettes 1 onion, thinly sliced 2 tbsp salt 500ml cider vinegar 200g sugar 1 ½ tsp dry mustard 1 ½ tsp crushed mustard seeds ½ tsp turmeric
Method:
Slice the courgettes about ¼ cm thick and place in a large, shallow dish along with the onions and salt, and mix thoroughly. Add cold water to cover and mix again to dissolve the salt. Leave for one hour and drain, and then dry thoroughly between tea towels or in a salad spinner. This whole process gets the excess juices out of the veg and stops the relish being too ‘wet’. Put the remaining ingredients in a pan and simmer for 3 minutes. Cool a little then add to the courgette/onion mix and stir. Transfer to sterile jars and leave in a fridge for at least one day before using.
