Introduction:
Dense, dark-brown rye bread topped with creamy, curried celeriac rémoulade, salad leaves, pastrami and sweet-sour cucumber pickle.

Method:
Put the mayonnaise, yoghurt, curry powder and ½ teaspoon of the mustard in a bowl. Season and stir together. Toss in the celeriac to coat. Taste and add a squeeze of lemon juice, more mustard or seasoning to your own taste. Lay out the slices of bread. Pile up each slice with lettuce leaves, a slice of pastrami and a dollop of the celeriac. Top with a spoonful of the cucumber pickle or some of the chopped gherkins and decorate with a sprig of dill.
