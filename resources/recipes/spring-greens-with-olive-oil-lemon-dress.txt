Spring greens with olive oil and lemon dressing
Introduction:
Celebrate the arrival of spring with this simple recipe, which really draws out the robust, full-flavoured taste of your greens. It may make more dressing than you need, but it keeps well. Use to dress other greens such as purple sprouting broccoli or kale later in the week. 
Ingredients:
100ml olive oil juice of 1-2 lemons, to taste 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped 1 bunch spring greens, tough stalks removed, leaves shredded
Method:
Mix the oil, lemon juice and herbs together in a bowl or jug and season. Add the juice of 1 lemon to start with, taste and add more as you prefer. Cook the greens in a pan of salted boiling water for about 3 minutes, until just tender. Drain and toss them in just enough of the dressing to coat, then serve straightaway. Keep any extra dressing in a screw-topped jar for a few days.
