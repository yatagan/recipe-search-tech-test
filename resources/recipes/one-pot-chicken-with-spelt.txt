One pot chicken & spelt with tarragon & seasonal roots
Introduction:
This is such a simple dish but healthy and with great flavour from our seasonal veg and fresh chicken stock. Nourishing and filling, it’s perfect for the new year.
Ingredients:
350g parsnips 2 large or more smaller carrots ¼ celeriac 125g pearled spelt 500ml chicken stock 1 tin chopped tomatoes 1 tbsp dried tarragon 2 bay leaves 300g diced chicken breast salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the parsnip(s) and carrots and cut into 2-3cm dice. Use a large sharp knife to peel and dice quarter of the celeriac into similar sized pieces. Rinse the spelt in a colander under cold water. Put it in a large saucepan with the pack of chicken stock, tinned tomatoes, tarragon and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Bring up to a low boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add the chicken, carrots, parsnips and celeriac to the pan and cook for a further 15 minutes, or until the veg and spelt are tender (NB the spelt will still have a little bite to it when cooked). Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the liquid as it cooks; you want a thick, stew-like consistency. Add a little water if needed. When the chicken is cooked (no pink juices remain) and the spelt is tender but still with some bite, check the seasoning and remove the bay leaves to serve.
