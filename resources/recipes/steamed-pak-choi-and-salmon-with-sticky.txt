Steamed pak choi and salmon with sticky sesame and jasmine rice
Introduction:
A quick and very healthy dinner of steamed salmon and pak choi served with jasmine rice and a sweet-sour Asian-style dressing. You can also use meaty white fish fillets like pollack instead of salmon, and spinach or chard instead of pak choi. Make sure it’s sustainably caught. 
Ingredients:
150g jasmine rice, rinsed well & drained 2 salmon fillets 1 large or 2 small heads of pak choi (about 200g), cut into ½ or ¼’s lengthways (depending on size) for the dressing: 1 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp kecap manis, or 1 tbsp soy sauce with a pinch of sugar 1 tsp rice wine vinegar 1 tsp sesame oil juice of 1 lime ½-1 red chilli, depending on preference, deseeded & finely chopped 1 tsp ginger, grated 1 small garlic clove, crushed
Method:
Put the rice in a saucepan. Cover with water and add more so it covers the rice by 3cm. Bring to the boil, then cover and lower the heat to its lowest setting. Simmer very gently for 15 minutes, keeping an eye that the rice doesn’t boil dry and catch on the bottom of the pan (add a touch more water if needed). Remove from the heat and leave to steam, still covered, for another 10 minutes. Make the dressing while the rice is cooking, put the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan and fry on a very low heat until just golden. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk with the rest of the dressing ingredients. Put the salmon in a steamer over a pan of simmering water. Steam for 3 minutes. Add the pak choi and steam for another 3 minutes. Fluff the rice up with a fork. Serve with the dressing drizzled over the salmon and pak choi.
