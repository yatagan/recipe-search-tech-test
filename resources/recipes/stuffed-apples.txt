Stuffed apples
Introduction:
These family-friendly stuffed apples make a healthy weeknight pud. The stuffing can easily be adapted depending on the nuts, spices and dried fruit you like best. It’s even more delicious topped off with yoghurt, crème fraîche or cream. Use seasonal British apples if you can. 
Ingredients:
4 tbsp raisins 4 tbsp warm port 4 tbsp chopped walnuts 4 tbsp light brown sugar 1 tsp ground cinnamon 4 large apples lemon juice
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Soak the raisins in the warm port, then mix with the chopped walnuts, light brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Core the apples. Fill the cavities with the mixture, then place the apples in a baking dish containing a splash of water. Sprinkle with lemon juice and bake for 40 minutes.
