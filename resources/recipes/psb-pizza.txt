Purple sprouting broccoli with bacon, wild garlic and camargue rice
Introduction:
This healthy dish makes a good, inexpensive weeknight meal-in-a-bowl. Camargue red rice has a lovely deep, nutty flavour and cooks down to be much softer than wholegrain brown rice. If you can't get hold of any, use brown basmati or a mixture of brown and wild rice. You could also try making this with quinoa. If you'd like a vegetarian version, just leave out the bacon. 
Ingredients:
1 litre veg stock (or water) 200g Camargue red rice, rinsed & drained 250g purple sprouting broccoli 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely sliced 8 smoked streaky bacon rashers, finely chopped (use scissors for ease) 6-8 leaves wild garlic, shredded (if you can't forage for wild, use a clove or two of finely chopped dried garlic) splash sherry or balsamic vinegar juice of Â½ lemon 50g hazelnuts, toasted in the oven or a frying pan, skins rubbed off, roughly chopped olive oil, for drizzling salt & pepper
Method:
In a large saucepan heat the stock until boiling and add the rice. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30-35 minutes, until the rice is just tender. Drain and keep to one side. Blanch or steam the purple sprouting broccoli for 3 minutes. Drain and refresh in cold water, then drain again. In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and bacon, fry for a few minutes, until the bacon is just cooked. Add the wild garlic leaves and fry for a couple more minutes. Add the purple sprouting broccoli, rice, vinegar and lemon juice, season with salt and pepper to taste and toss together to combine. Serve topped with the hazelnuts and a drizzle of olive oil.
