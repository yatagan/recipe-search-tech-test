Courgette kuku
Introduction:
Kuku is a Middle Eastern type of frittata or set omelette, made with a very high herbs-to-eggs ratio. It's great served at room temperature with a salad on the side. Our version is ideal for using up courgettes. If you can, use whole spices and grind them yourself; they are central to this recipe and the stronger and fresher they taste the better. 
Ingredients:
advieh spice blend: Â¼ tsp each turmeric, nutmeg, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground ginger 2 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 red or white onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 500g courgettes, sliced 2 tbsp chives, chopped 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 6 eggs, lightly beaten 100ml milk salt & pepper
Method:
Make the spice blend by mixing all the spices in a small bowl. Heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan and fry the onion for 5 minutes to soften. Add the garlic, spices and courgettes and fry for another 2 minutes. Stir in the fresh herbs and season. Whisk the eggs with the milk and pour over the top. Cook very slowly for a few minutes, until just set on the bottom. Finish under a medium grill or in the oven until just set all the way through (test by tipping it sideways - no runny egg should appear).
