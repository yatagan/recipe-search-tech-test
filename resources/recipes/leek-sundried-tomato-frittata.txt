Leek and sun-dried tomato frittata
Introduction:
A frittata is an excellent fall-back dinner: once everything's chopped ready, it takes a maximum of 15 minutes to cook. Use this simple recipe more as a guideline â€“ add in other green veg, some blue cheese or Parmesan, or anything else you have lurking in the fridge. This is good warm and at room temperature and needs nothing more with it than a green salad and maybe some bread. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 3 leeks, cleaned & thinly sliced (use green & white parts) 8 sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped handful fresh parsley, chopped 4 eggs, beaten salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat the grill. Heat the oil, add the leeks, cook gently for 10 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes, parsley and season. Pour the eggs over the leeks. Cook gently for 10 minutes. Place under the grill, cook for 5 minutes until set.
