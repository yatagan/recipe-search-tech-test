Scandinavian-style beetroot and potato salad
Introduction:
A creamy, crunchy Nordic salad punctuated with apple, radishes and gherkins. This stands up well to being carted around for a picnic or packed lunch. For a light dinner, serve with boiled eggs, pickled herrings, dense, dark rye bread and a green salad. 
Ingredients:
450g beetroot, trimmed of leaves 400g new potatoes 1 mini cucumber (or ½ an ordinary one), diced 1 apple, cored & diced 2 bunched onions, finely sliced 2 large or 6 smaller gherkins, finely sliced or diced if large 1 bunch radishes, finely sliced (optional) 2 tbsp crème fraîche 2 tbsp yoghurt 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the beetroot until tender, about 30-45 minutes, depending on size. If they’re really large, they can take up to an hour or so. Drain and leave until cool enough to handle, then rub off the skins (they should come away easily). Boil the potatoes for 12-15 minutes, until tender. Drain and leave to cool. Chop the beetroot and potatoes into bite sized pieces. Put in a large bowl and add the cucumber, apple, onions, gherkins and radish if using. Mix the crème fraîche, yoghurt, dill and parsley in a small bowl. Season. Gently mix into the veg.
