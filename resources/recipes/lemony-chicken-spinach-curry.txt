Lemony chicken and spinach curry
Introduction:
Tender diced chicken and earthy spinach infused with warm spices. Quick enough for midweek, serve this with basmati rice or naan bread, a dollop of plain yoghurt and mango chutney if you have it. The spinach can be replaced by chard, kale or spring or winter greens – just increase the cooking time a little. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. sunflower 800g chicken leg, thigh or breast, diced 2 onions, sliced 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 4-5cm fresh ginger, peeled & finely chopped 2 chillies, finely chopped 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp each cumin & coriander seeds, lightly toasted & ground 10 cardamom pods juice of 2 lemons 400ml veg or chicken stock 200g spinach, tough stalks removed & leaves roughly chopped if large large handful fresh coriander, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Add the chicken pieces and fry on a high heat, turning once, until golden brown (don’t overcrowd the pan, cook in batches if you need to). Remove to a plate. Add the onion, and a splash more oil if needed. Fry gently for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, chillies and spices. Fry for another 2 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan, along with the lemon juice and stock. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Add the spinach and stir for a minute or two to wilt the leaves. Remove the cardamom pods (or warn everyone not to eat them!), season and stir in the coriander to serve.
