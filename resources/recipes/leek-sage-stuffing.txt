Leek and sage stuffing
Introduction:
This is a good dish to have on the side for feeding vegetarians when you have a roast chicken or turkey. If there are no vegetarians, you could add chopped bacon or grated apple for a different flavour and texture. This freezes well, so you can make enough for a few roasts. 
Ingredients:
3-4 leeks, chopped 60g butter 1 tbsp fresh sage, chopped 100g breadcrumbs 1 egg, beaten 25g butter
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Sweat the leeks gently in 50g ofbutter. Add the rest of the ingredients. Use the remaining butter to grease an ovenproof dish. Pour in the mixture and spread evenly. Bake for 20 minutes.
