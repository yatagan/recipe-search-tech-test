Chicken and Chinese leaves
Introduction:
This easy twenty minute chicken recipe is ideal for a weeknight dinner. If you'd like to bulk it out, serve with steamed rice or egg noodles. If you'd like it vegetarian, replace the chicken with tofu. The secret to a good stir-fry is not to overcrowd the pan, so if you double this recipe, cook it in two batches. 
Ingredients:
300g skinless chicken breasts 1 bunch spring onions ½ head Chinese leaves, such as pak choi ½ small cucumber 2 tsp vegetable oil 2 tbsp light soy sauce 2 tbsp dry sherry 220g tin bamboo shoots 1 tbsp chopped chives
Method:
Cut the chicken into thin slices and set aside. Trim and slice the spring onions. Trim and shred the Chinese leaves. Cut the cucumber into thick slices (removing the skin of you prefer). Heat the oil in a wok or heavy based pan until very hot. Add the chicken and stir fry for 7-10 minutes until lightly golden. Add the soy sauce, sherry, spring onions and cucumber then stir fry for one minute. Finally add the bamboo shoots and Chinese leaves and stir fry for a further 2 minutes. Serve on its own or with noodles or rice and sprinkle with the chopped chives.
