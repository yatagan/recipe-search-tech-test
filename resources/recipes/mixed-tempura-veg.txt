Mixed tempura veg
Introduction:
Tempura batter is light and frothy and barely coats the veg. It can be used to fry fish pieces or tofu too. Serve with dipping sauces like our chilli sauce. Pretty much any type of veg can be used, providing you cut it into small enough pieces so it cooks in the short frying time. Just don't try Jerusalem artichokes – or perhaps let us know if yours work; ours did a vanishing act in the fryer! You could try Brussels sprouts, but blanch them first as otherwise they'll be too hard (keep the root intact to stop them falling apart). 
Ingredients:
1kg mixed veg, e.g. carrots, courgettes, aubergine, peppers (cut into sticks), broccoli or cauliflower (cut into small florets or the stalks cut into thin sticks) 400g plain flour 1 tsp salt 600ml chilled bottled sparkling water oil for deep frying paprika or cayenne pepper for sprinkling (optional)
Method:
Pat all the veg you are using with kitchen paper to remove any excess moisture (the batter sticks better if they are dry). In a large bowl, whisk the flour and the water together with the salt. Heat the oil in a deep fat fryer or wok (if you’re comfortable using it for deep frying), until it reaches 180˚C. Working in small batches, toss the veg in in the batter and separate each one before immediately putting it in the fryer. Cook for 2 minutes, turn the veg carefully using heatproof tongs and cook for another minute or so, until the batter is lightly browned. Use a slotted spoon to remove each piece, then drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with paprika or cayenne pepper to serve.
