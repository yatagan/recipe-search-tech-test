Wheatberries and purple sprouting broccoli with crispy garlic and chilli
Introduction:
A hearty and healthy lunch combining toothsome wheatberries, clean greens and crispy fried onions. Wheatberries are the entire wheat kernel except for the hull. They take a while to cook but have a good nutty texture, lending real substance to a dish. 
Ingredients:
100g purple sprouting broccoli, trimmed if necessary 100g wheatberries (or one of the alternatives below) 4 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 1 fresh red chilli, very finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, very finely sliced handful of Crispy Fried Onions (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the purple sprouting broccoli for 3â€“4 minutes, until just tender. Remove with a slotted spoon and plunge into very cold water before draining. Add the wheatberries to the same water and cook for 25 minutes, or until cooked but still chewy. Drain in a colander. Wipe out the pan and heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the chilli and garlic and fry, stirring, until the garlic has turned golden. Add the broccoli and fry for a couple more minutes, then add the drained wheatberries and a handful of crispy fried onions, if using. Mix everything together, check the seasoning and add a dash more oil if it seems dry. Serve warm.
