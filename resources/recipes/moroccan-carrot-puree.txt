Moroccan carrot purée
Introduction:
Eat this easy spiced carrot purée as a snack – either as a dip with pittas, or spread on toast. Or try it warm as a side with duck or chicken. A very good way to use up a few extra carrots. 
Ingredients:
500g carrots ½-1 tsp harissa or 1 tsp paprika pinch cayenne 1-2 tbsp cumin 3 tbsp wine vinegar 4 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed ¼-½ tsp ginger few olives
Method:
Peel the carrots and boil in salted water until very soft. Drain and mash with a fork, then stir in the other ingredients apart from the olives (or you could purée everything in a blender). Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with olives.
