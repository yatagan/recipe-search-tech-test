Citrus chicken goujons
Introduction:
Serve this with a winter leaf salad or with spring greens with chickpeas, garlic and mint. It would be good with a cucumber and yoghurt dip, or garlic mayonnaise. Sumac is a great Middle Eastern spice with a lemony flavour, fairly widely available. It gives an extra citrus zing but if you can't get it, use the lemon zest on its own. 
Ingredients:
100g white breadcrumbs zest of 2 lemons 2 tsp sumac powder 2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 tbsp plain flour 2 eggs, beaten 300g chicken breast, cut into thin strips (or mini fillets) oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower salt & pepper
Method:
In a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, lemon zest and sumac. Season and stir in the parsley. Put the flour in another bowl and the beaten egg in another, then, in batches, coat the chicken strips first in flour, then egg, then the breadcrumb mixture. In a large frying pan, heat just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan to a medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes, turn over and cook for another 3 minutes until the breadcrumbs are golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink juices). Do this in batches if necessary and keep the goujons warm in the oven; donâ€™t crowd the pan or the breadcrumbs will not crisp up enough.
