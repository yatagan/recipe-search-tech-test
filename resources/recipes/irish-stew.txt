Irish stew
Introduction:
Cuts suitable for stew vary from scrag (neck) to best end and you have the choice of boneless, using previously made lamb stock, or on the bone. Lamb shoulder steaks on the bone are very good. I think using both waxy and floury potatoes is a revelation, with the floury ones breaking down to thicken the sauce and the waxy holding their texture and shape.' (Ben Watson) 
Ingredients:
900g neck fillets 1 tbsp seasoned plain flour 450g floury potatoes, peeled & cut into chunks 450g carrots, peeled & cut into 4cm chunks 1 onion, thickly sliced 1 sprig of thyme 450g waxy potatoes, peeled & cut into chunks 1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Cut the lamb into 4cm chunks toss in the seasoned flour and scatter half into a heavy casserole, followed by half the floury potatoes, carrots and onion and thyme. Repeat the exercise with the rest of the seasoned lamb, potatoes, carrots and onion. Pour over about a litre of boiling water or lamb stock and bring to the boil on the stove - skimming away any scum that rises to the surface. Now lower to a bare simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 1Â½ hours by which time the floury potatoes will have collapsed into the sauce. Check seasoning and adjust if necessary. Add the waxy potatoes to the stew, making sure they are sitting in the sauce. Cook for a further 20 minutes, then serve in warmed bowls and scatter with chopped parsley.
