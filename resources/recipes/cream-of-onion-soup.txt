Cream of onion soup
Introduction:
This bistro classic, enriched with cream, makes a good quick supper with a hunk of crusty bread. Garlic bread goes especially well. Season it liberally and garnish with chopped parsley and croutons. You could stir in a tablespoon of sherry before blending. 
Ingredients:
50g butter 5 medium sized onions, chopped 3 medium sized potatoes, diced nutmeg 1 litre chicken stock 300ml single cream small handful parsley, chopped handful croutons
Method:
In a saucepan, melt the butter and add the onions with the potatoes, nutmeg and seasoning. Cover with a lid and stew gently for 20 minutes. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Boil for 10 minutes and pass through a fine mouli or blend. Return to the saucepan and add the cream. Gently reheat (do not boil once cream is added). Serve and sprinkle each bowl with parsley and croutons.
