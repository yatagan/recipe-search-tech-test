Method:
Steam or boil purple sprouting broccoli for about 3 minutes, until just tender. Serve with a little melted butter and lemon juice, seasoned with salt and pepper. A few chopped toasted hazelnuts would be good too. Blanch purple sprouting broccoli in boiling water for a few minutes, until just tender, drain, refresh in cold water to stop the cooking, then griddle until slightly charred. Serve with a hollandaise sauce or a poached egg, with some ham if you like. Blanch as above, then pan fry with a little olive oil, chilli and garlic. Serve as a side dish or toss through pasta.
