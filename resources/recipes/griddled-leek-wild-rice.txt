Griddled leeks, wild rice and quinoa, chervil and mustard dressing
Introduction:
Griddled leeks atop an aromatic pile of wild rice and quinoa with a sharp lemon, mustard and chervil dressing. This is a clean, nourishing vegetarian dinner, or could be eaten as a substantial side to chicken or fish. You could also add other griddled veg – slices of courgette, red pepper and aubergine work well (no need for pre-boiling). 
Ingredients:
75g wild rice 3 medium leeks, cut into 5cm lengths 50g quinoa (use a mixture of red & white quinoa for colour - red has a nutty flavour) 3 tbsp olive oil, plus some for drizzling 1 tbsp vinegar (whatever you have to hand - white, balsamic, cider) 2 tsp Dijon mustard juice of ½ lemon, to taste 15g fresh chervil leaves salt & pepper
Method:
Boil the wild rice for 35-40 minutes until tender. Meanwhile, boil the leeks in another pan for approx 8 minutes, until tender. Scoop them out with a slotted spoon and put in a bowl of cold water to refresh, then drain. Add the quinoa to the pan the leeks were in and boil for 15 minutes. Whisk the oil, vinegar, mustard and lemon juice in a small bowl. Season. Heat a griddle pan. Toss the drained leeks in a little oil. Griddle on each side to make ridge marks. Drain the rice and quinoa. Toss in the dressing with the chervil, saving a few leaves. Check the seasoning. Serve on a platter with the leeks and garnish with the reserved chervil leaves.
