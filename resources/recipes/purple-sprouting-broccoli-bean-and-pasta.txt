Purple sprouting broccoli, bean and pasta soup
Introduction:
This is a lighter version of the traditional Italian pasta e fagioli (pasta and beans), but it's still filling enough to be a meal in itself. It's nutritious, cheap and quick to make â€“ ideal weeknight dinner fare. Calabrese (normal) broccoli can be substituted for purple sprouting. 
Ingredients:
1 red onion, chopped 4 tbsp olive oil 6 garlic cloves, minced 4 tsp fresh herbs; oregano, thyme, parsley, chopped 400g purple sprouting broccoli, chopped finely 550g cooked white beans with cooking liquor (2x150g cans of cannellini beans undrained) 1 litre chicken or vegetable stock 100g pasta, broken spaghetti or tiny shells Parmesan, grated (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
Cook the onion in the olive oil until soft, add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the herbs and broccoli. Cook over a moderate heat until the broccoli is soft. Add the beans, liquor and stock and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the pasta and cook it in the soup until al dente. Season well and serve with the grated Parmesan.
