Roasted veg toad in the hole with onion gravy
Introduction:
A vegetarian version of toad in the hole. Try this comforting classic with all sorts of veg: even roasted broccoli would be good. Some will take longer to cook than others, so add at different stages – root veg first, then the quicker cookers like peppers and broccoli. 
Ingredients:
for the batter: 75g plain flour 1 egg 100ml milk 25ml water for the gravy: knob of butter 250g onions, peeled & finely sliced 1 tsp sugar splash Worcestershire sauce (use balsamic vinegar if vegetarian) 1 tbsp plain flour 450ml veg or chicken stock for the veg: about 1-1.5kg mixed veg e.g. parsnips, squash, carrots, swede, red pepper, celeriac, potato, onion olive oil leaves from 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or some chopped rosemary leaves (or 1 tsp dried herbs if fresh not available) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Make the batter in a large bowl: Mix the flour with a little salt. Make a well and add the egg. Mix with the flour then gradually add the milk and water, whisking until you have a smooth batter. Make the gravy: heat the butter in a pan and add the onions, a little salt and a teaspoon of sugar. Gently cook until the onions are very soft and turning a caramel colour. Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce or balsamic vinegar if vegetarian, then the flour and stir well. Gradually add the stock a ladle at a time, stirring constantly until the gravy is smooth. For the veg: In a baking dish toss the veg in a little olive oil, add the herbs, season with salt and pepper and roast until tender. Remove from the oven and add a couple more tablespoons of oil to the baking dish. Turn the oven up to 220°C/Gas 8, return the dish and veg to the oven until the oil is hot, then add the batter to the baking dish. Cook for 25-30 minutes or until the batter has puffed up, looks brown and crisp on top and has cooked through. Serve with the onion gravy.
