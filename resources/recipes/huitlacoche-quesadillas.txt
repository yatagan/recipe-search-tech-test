huitlacoche quesadillas
Introduction:
Chilli-spiced sweet corn sandwiched with melting cheese into a warm tortilla. This crowd-pleasing Mexican dish goes well with salad, salsa and guacamole. It’s easy to customise according to your box contents: try adding wilted kale or spinach, finely diced red peppers or tomatoes, fried mushrooms or roasted sweet potato. The cheddar can also be substituted or mixed with any other type of cheese you fancy. 
Ingredients:
2-3 cobs of huitlacoche corn, galls removed as described (around 300g of galls) 1 onion, finely chopped 1 green jalapeno chilli, deseeded & finely chopped 3 tbsp olive oil 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped corn tortillas to serve (not the wheat flour type) 150g Cheddar, grated salt & pepper
Method:
De-husk and de-silk the corn cobs. Next, stand the cob on its base and slice downwards, using the back of a knife to remove the kernel galls. Discard any that have gone brown or slimy. Don’t worry if the galls burst as you remove them, though equally if some of the smaller ones retain their integrity, this will give texture to your dish. Set aside and, using the sharp side of the knife, remove any healthy yellow kernels and put to one side, separate to the galls. Discard any that have not matured to a plump golden yellow. Using a heavy-based pan, gently fry the onion and chilli in the olive oil until soft. Add the garlic and any healthy yellow sweetcorn and continue to cook gently. Add the galls, season and cook over a moderate heat until most of the galls have collapsed and any excessive moisture has been driven off. Spread on a hot toasted tortilla, sprinkle over some grated Cheddar, then warm face-up in a pan to melt the cheese. Fold and enjoy. Great with a fresh salsa, guacamole and some shredded lettuce.
