3 tbsp oil for frying, e.g. vegetable or sunflower 1 tbsp walnut oil 1 onion, finely sliced Â½ red cabbage, finely sliced or shredded 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 2 tbsp lemon juice 120g walnuts, halved or in pieces 2 tsp Dijon mustard salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oils in a large frying pan or wok. Add the onion, cabbage, garlic and stir for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice, walnuts and mustard. Cook for a few minutes more until the cabbage is slightly tender. Season and serve.
