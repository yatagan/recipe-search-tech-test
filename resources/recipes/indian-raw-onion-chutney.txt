Indian raw onion chutney
Introduction:
This fast chutney should be somewhere between fairly and eye-wateringly spicy, depending on your taste. If raw red onion has too harsh a flavour for you, try using a few shallots or a sweeter white onion instead. This is good for a curry dinner â€“ either added as a condiment or used as a dip. It pairs well with cooling raita. 
Ingredients:
1 large red onion, finely chopped 1 heaped tsp ground cumin 1/2 tsp chilli powder 1/2 tsp sweet paprika 2 tbsp lemon juice
Method:
Mix all the ingredients. Taste and add a little more cumin or chilli if it needs it.
