Kohlrabi remoulade
Introduction:
Despite it's alien appearance, kohlrabi is mild-flavoured and crunchy. It's a good alternative to celeriac in remoulade. Leave for half an hour before eating to let the flavours meld. You could try making your own mayonnaise for this; or fry crispy lardons of bacon and scatter them over the top of the dish before serving; or add a little apple or celeriac. 
Ingredients:
1 medium kohlrabi juice of 1 lemon 3 tbsp Dijon mustard 150ml good mayonnaise 1 tbsp double cream 1 tbsp parsley, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Peel the kohlrabi and cut it into matchsticks about 3mm thick, either by hand or using a mandolin. Add them to a large pan of boiling water and cook for 1 minute, then drain well and leave to cool. Mix the rest of the ingredients together in a large bowl. Season well and mix in the kohlrabi.
