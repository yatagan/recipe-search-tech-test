Pasta with onion and anchovy sauce
Introduction:
A speedy, very piquant, store-cupboard meal. This Venetian pasta dish is traditionally served with bucatini or bigoli, both types of thick spaghetti with a hole running through the middle. Use spaghetti or linguine as an alternative. The longer and slower you're able to cook the onions, the deeper and sweeter this pasta will be. 
Ingredients:
200g pasta - linguine or spaghetti 3 tbsp olive oil 300g onions, finely chopped 20g anchovy fillets salt & pepper
Method:
Boil a pan of water. Add a little salt and the pasta and cook as per the packet instructions, until al dente. While the pasta is cooking heat the olive oil and on a medium heat fry the onion in a heavy based frying pan, until soft (about 6-8 minutes). Add the anchovies and stir through the onions until they dissolve. Drain the cooked pasta and combine with the onion and anchovy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to season.
