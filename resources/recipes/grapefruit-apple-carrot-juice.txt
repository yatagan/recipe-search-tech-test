Grapefruit, apple & carrot juice
Introduction:
Grapefruit can be invigoratingly sharp, sour and sweet, but a bit much in large doses. Hand in hand with the more neutral apple and carrots, it makes for a longer drink that is easier on the stomach. This should yield about 3-400ml of juice, but will vary depending on the oomph of your juicer. The trick to getting maximum flavour is to start with the more fibrous and difficult-to-juice items, and finish with the juicier and higher-yield items; they will flush through all the preceding flavour. Ingredients are listed in the best order in which to plunge.
