Pea Shoot, Courgette & Whipped Feta Toasts with Burnt Lemon
Introduction:
You can treat this recipe as a posh open sandwich or a starter. The pea shoots are the first delicate stalks of a pea plant. More than just a garnish, they are sweet and succulent with a definite pea flavour. 
Ingredients:
2 courgettes olive oil 150g feta 100ml yoghurt 1 lemon Â½ tbsp light brown sugar 2 slices sourdough bread 40g pea shoots small handful of mint - chopped small handful of parsley - chopped pinch of sumac
Method:
Use a peeler to pull the courgette into long ribbons, stopping when you reach the soft core. You can use them raw or lightly griddle them; whichever you prefer. Season them well and dress with a little olive oil. Keep to one side. Mix the feta and yoghurt with 2 tbsp of olive oil. Beat together with a fork until smooth and spreadable. Halve the lemon and sprinkle the sugar on the cut sides. Rub it in with you thumb until dissolved. Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Press the lemons into the pan, cut-side down. Cook for 1-2 mins until the surface has become caramelized and lightly burnt. The pan may smoke a bit, so be aware of ventilation in your kitchen. Toast or griddle the bread. Pile on the courgettes and whipped feta. Top with a generous pile of pea shoots. Garnish with the fresh herbs, a pinch of sumac and a squeeze of burnt lemon juice.
