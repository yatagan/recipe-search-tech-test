Finger-licking good chicken wings
Introduction:
This sings of summer – crisp, zingy chicken wings. Wonderfully cheap and very moreish – allow at least 2 per person. Cooked in 30 minutes, this is a good weeknight dinner with rice and greens – or try on a warm evening with nothing but a cool beer. 
Ingredients:
1 kg chicken wing joints olive oil for brushing 2 tsp toasted sesame oil 1 tbsp olive oil grated zest & juice of 1 lime 1 red chilli & 1 green chilli, seeded & finely sliced 2 garlic cloves, crushed, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Brush the joints with olive oil and season. Roast for 25-30 minutes on a large roasting tray, basting once, until golden, crispy and cooked through. Mix the oils with lime juice, chilli, garlic and zest in a large bowl, set aside for flavours to develop. Tip the hot wings into the bowl of chilli marinade and toss to coat. Serve scattered with coriander.
