Runner bean ratatouille
Introduction:
This very easy to follow vegetarian recipe is a great way of using up a glut of runner beans. Eat for a healthy midweek meal with rice or bulgur, or alongside pork chops. Any leftovers freeze well. 
Ingredients:
400g runner beans, topped, tailed & stringed 3 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely sliced 6 large tomatoes or 1x 400g tin tomatoes 1 tsp sugar 1 bay leaf 2 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 3 sprigs thyme
Method:
If using fresh tomatoes, peel them by cutting a cross in the skin at one end and plunging into a pan of boiling water for 1 minute, until the cut skin starts to peel back. Remove from the water, peel and roughly chop. Slice the runner beans diagonally into long strips about 1cm wide. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan. Add the onions and sweat until translucent and beginning to soften. Add the beans, tomatoes, garlic, sugar and herbs. Cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes until the beans are soft and the sauce is thick â€“ if it is still thin, remove the pan lid and bubble until it reaches the right consistency. Serve warm or at room temperature.
