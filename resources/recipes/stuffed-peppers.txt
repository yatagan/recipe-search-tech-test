Stuffed peppers
Introduction:
These Piedmont-style roasted peppers are easy to construct and have a marvelous, vibrant flavour. They're much improved if left for a couple of hours after cooking to let the tastes develop. Eat as a starter or a light meal, with bread to sop up the oil and juices. 
Ingredients:
2 peppers 4 cherry tomatoes 4 anchovy fillets 4 tsp capers olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 200Â°C/Gas 6. Cut the red peppers in half, scoop out the seeds and put a cherry tomato, an anchovy fillet and a teaspoon of capers in each half. Drizzle with olive oil, season and then roast for about 20 minutes, until the peppers are soft and slightly coloured. Serve warm.
