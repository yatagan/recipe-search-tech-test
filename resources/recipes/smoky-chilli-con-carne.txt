Smoky chilli con carne
Introduction:
A large slow cooker or crock pot is ideal for this recipe, but you’ll need to double the cooking time. You can use tinned kidney beans; just add them for the last 10 minutes of cooking. 
Ingredients:
500g dried kidney beans 500g braising steak, cut into 1cm dice sunflower oil 4 large onions, diced 4 large carrots, diced 500g beef mince 8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 1 tbsp ground cumin 2 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp dried thyme 1 heaped tsp ground coriander seed ½ tsp hot smoked paprika 2-3 smoked chillies (use 1-2 fresh plus extra smoked paprika) 2 tins chopped tomatoes
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas Mark 2. Cook the kidney beans according to instructions, drain and set aside. Take a frying pan and brown the diced beef, then transfer to a warm casserole dish. Next fry the onions for a few minutes, add the carrots and then add the mince to brown. Transfer to the same warmed casserole dish. Add the garlic, spices, herbs, tomatoes and two thirds of the chillies and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Check you’ve got the heat about right and add a little more chilli if you think it needs it, but be careful; too much could ruin it! Cook in the oven for an hour, stir in the beans and cook for another hour. Serve with the usual suspects; yoghurt, guacamole, lime, marinated red onion etc.
