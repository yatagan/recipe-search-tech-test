Rhubarb crumble
Introduction:
A very easy, five-ingredient recipe. This is a versatile way to enjoy this quintessential English winter fruit: you can add in any other fruit you fancy, from oranges to apples and dates, or try a shake of cinnamon or few drops of vanilla essence. This dessert is very easy to make and a great excuse for eating lot of cream or custard. Replace the flour with oats and fine oatmeal for a gluten free alternative. 
Ingredients:
2-4 rhubarb stalks, cut into slices 2cm thick 50g soft light brown sugar 150g rolled oats 100g butter 165g plain flour
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Place the rhubarb in a deep pie dish. Sprinkle half the sugar on top. Put the oats, butter and remaining sugar and flour in a food processor and pulse until the mixture starts to come together. Spread the crumble over the fruit and bake for 35-40 minutes until the rhubarb is tender and the crumble is browned. Serve with clotted cream.
