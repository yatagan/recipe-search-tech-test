Roasted fennel
Introduction:
Sweetly caramelised oven-baked fennel with a hint of chilli. This veggie side is good with pork, white fish or chicken. Eat it either warm or at room temperature. It’s also good with a handful of pitted black olives thrown in for the last 10 minutes of cooking. 
Ingredients:
2 fennel bulbs 1 dried red chilli, finely sliced ½ tsp fennel seeds zest & juice of 1 lemon 4 tbsp olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Trim the fennel, removing any tough outer leaves and cut into quarters lengthwise, or sixths or eighths if the fennel is very large. In a bowl, mix together all the ingredients and season well. Place in a roasting dish, cover with foil and roast for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes.
