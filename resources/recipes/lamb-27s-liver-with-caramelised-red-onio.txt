Lamb's liver with caramelised red onion
Introduction:
'Lamb's liver is one of my favourites. Thinly sliced with a dusting of seasoned flour, flash-fried and slightly pink. It is equally good with bacon and mash or in a sandwich with a dollop of mustard. Or try slices of liver with caramelised onion and sauce spooned beside it, seasonal vegetables and buttery mashed potatoes.' (Ben Watson) 
Ingredients:
600g lamb's liver seasoned flour, to dust 50g butter 250ml chicken stock 1 tbsp crème fraiche 2 red onions, sliced 1 rounded tsp ground cumin 2-3 tsp soft brown sugar a few drops balsamic vinegar salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 120°C/Gas ½. Dust the slices of lamb's liver with seasoned flour. Melt half the butter until foaming, then fry off the livers over a fairly high heat until browned on both sides but left pink inside - only a couple of minutes each side - then move to the warm oven to rest. Add stock to the pan and swirl around to incorporate meat juices then whisk in the crème fraiche - keep warm. Add the rest of the butter to a sauté pan and fry off the onion with cumin, salt and pepper over a medium heat to give it colour without burning or over-browning. As it begins to soften sprinkle over the sugar and continue until it’s luxuriously sticky-sweet. Finish with a few drops of balsamic to taste.
