Potato, feta and wet garlic cakes with herb mayonnaise
Introduction:
The vegetarian answer to a fish cake, these punchy but comforting potato cakes are very easy to make and a lovely light lunch or dinner with a side of green salad or buttery peas. If you have leftover mash they can be made in no time. Chilling is optional, but will help them hold together better. These can be fried or baked – the former will give you a crispier finish, but uses more oil. 
Ingredients:
1 bulb wet garlic, finely sliced (use green & white parts) 50g butter 450g potatoes, boiled & mashed 100g feta cheese, grated or finely crumbled 1 tbsp flour 2 eggs, beaten 40g breadcrumbs 2-3 tbsp oil for frying e.g. vegetable or sunflower 4 tbsp mayonnaise 2 tsp capers, drained & finely chopped 1 tsp Dijon mustard 2 tbsp fresh herbs, finely chopped - parsley, dill, basil, mint few drops lemon juice, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Sweat the garlic in half the butter until soft but not coloured. Mix into the potatoes with the remaining butter (melted), cheese, seasoning, flour and one egg and beat until smooth. Chill in the fridge for 20-30 minutes. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and form into a roll. Cut into 2-3cm slices and shape into round cakes. Brush with the remaining egg and coat with breadcrumbs. Chill for a further 30 minutes. Combine all the remaining ingredients to make the herb mayonnaise while the potato cakes are chilling. Preheat oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Place the cakes on a non-stick tray or one lined with baking parchment and bake for about 20 minutes. Alternatively gently fry the cakes in the oil until golden brown.
