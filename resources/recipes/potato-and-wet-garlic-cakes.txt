Potato and wet garlic cakes
Introduction:
This seasonal potato cake is a great way to enjoy wild garlic's lovely pungent flavour. You can also shape the potato mix into little individual patties if you'd prefer. When the wild garlic's over, try using leeks in their stead. 
Ingredients:
500g floury potatoes 60g butter 2 egg yolks 3 wet garlic, finely sliced olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender and then drain and peel - passing potatoes through a food mill, potato ricer or as most people will do, mashing thoroughly. Beat the butter and egg yolks into the potato, then season and stir in the garlic. Grease an ovenproof frying pan with olive oil and press in mixture then bake for 45 minutes until firm. Invert the potato cake and cut into wedges. Serve with a simple salad of little gems and cherry tomatoes.
