warm salad of potatoes, tomatoes and chorizo
Introduction:
The tomatoes are slow roasted to make them sticky and intensely sweet. 
Ingredients:
200-250g cherry tomatoes, halved olive oil 500g new potatoes, cut into even-sized pieces 500g chorizo sausages for cooking, cut in fat slices 2-3 handfuls rocket or other salad leaves 2 tsp sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar small handful fresh parsley, chopped, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 150°C/Gas 2. To roast the cherry tomatoes, place them cut side up on a baking sheet lined with non-stick parchment. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and add salt and pepper. Roast for 1½-2hrs until wrinkled and sticky but still moist. You need to do this in advance unless you have two ovens. Increase oven to 220°C/Gas 8. Cook the potatoes in salted water until just tender – about 6-10 minutes depending on size. Drain and allow to steam dry. Heat three tablespoons of olive oil in a deep roasting tray in the oven for 5 minutes then add the potatoes. Roast for 20-30 minutes (depending on size) until golden. While they are cooking fry the chorizo in 1 teaspoon olive oil, turning the pieces to ensure even cooking, until nicely coloured. Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter. Mix the cooked potato and chorizo with a few drops of vinegar and a little salt if needed and heap on top of the salad leaves. Scatter the tomatoes over the top and add another sprinkle of vinegar and a drizzle of fresh olive oil. Finish with the parsley and serve warm.
