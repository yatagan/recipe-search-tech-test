roasted broccoli with lemon, chilli and garlic
Introduction:
It is the speed of cooking that makes this work. The stalks should be just tender and very slightly coloured. If the florets have burnt black then it is back to the drawing board, so watch them carefully. 
Ingredients:
250g head of calabrese broccoli zest and juice of ½ lemon 1 thumb-sized red chilli, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
Method:
Heat the oven to 220˚C/Gas 8. Split the broccoli down into manageable, bite-sized florets. Make sure each floret has a long piece of stalk attached, cut pencil-thick. Put the broccoli onto a shallow oven tray, toss in some light olive oil and season with salt. Roast for 4 minutes. Add the chilli, garlic and lemon zest, mix well, then pop back in the oven to continue roasting for a further 3-4 minutes or until the broccoli is done. Finish with a dash of lemon juice and more salt if needed.
