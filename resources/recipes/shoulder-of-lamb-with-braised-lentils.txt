Shoulder of lamb with braised lentils
Introduction:
Although not offering as high a ratio of lean meat as leg, shoulder has more flavour and benefits from slower cooking. This makes a lovely Easter meal accompanied by a big green salad with lots of rocket. Lentils are amazingly lamb friendly – try reheating them the next day with leftover scraps of lamb and a sausage or two to get even more out of this recipe. 
Ingredients:
for the roast: 1kg joint lamb shoulder 3 garlic cloves, crushed 1 tsp salt 1 tsp cumin seed 1 tsp dried mint 2 tbsp olive oil for the lentils: 4 streaky bacon rashers, finely chopped 1 each onion, celery stick & carrot, finely chopped 400g dark green lentils, soaked for 1 hr 2 tbsp olive oil veg stock (double the volume of soaked lentils) salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Trim the lamb of excess fat and score it with a sharp knife. Crush the garlic, salt, cumin seed and mint in a pestle and mortar. Mix with the olive oil and smear over the lamb. Leave for an hour at room temperature. Place the lamb on a rack in a roasting tray. Roast for 2 hours, turning a couple of times. Meanwhile, fry the bacon, onion, celery and carrot in the olive oil until soft, then add the lentils and stir for 1-2 minutes. Cover with hot stock, season, and gently cook until the lentils are tender (about 30 minutes). Serve the lentils with pieces of roast lamb on top.
