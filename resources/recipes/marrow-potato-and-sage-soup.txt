Marrow, potato and sage soup
Introduction:
Sustaining and nutritious, the key to this marrow soup is good stock and fresh herbs. If you have time, deep-fry a handful of sage leaves for a few seconds to scatter over the soup just before serving. 
Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, chopped 40g butter 750g marrow, peeled & diced 350g potato, peeled & diced 4 fresh sage leaves 2 tsp sugar 1.2 litres veg or chicken stock 150ml single cream fresh parsley or sage leaves, chopped, to garnish salt & pepper
Method:
In a large saucepan cook the onion and garlic gently in the butter until tender, without browning. Add the marrow, potato and sage leaves, turn and coat in the butter, cover tightly and sweat over a low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Now add the sugar, stock, salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until the vegetables are very tender. Cool slightly, fish out the sage leaves and discard, and then liquidize the soup in several batches. Return to the pan and add the necessary extra stock or water. Adjust seasoning. When ready to serve, bring back to the boil, draw off the heat and stir in the single cream. Garnish with chopped parsley or sage leaves.
