Squash laksa with noodles
Introduction:
Laksa is a comforting noodle bowl: a spiced coconut broth with vegetables and/or meat. In this case the star of the show is seasonal squash. Butternut squash can vary a little in size, but use approximately half, once peeled.
Ingredients:
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil 2 tbsp red Thai curry paste 1 tsp turmeric 1 tbsp tamari 400ml tin coconut milk 1 tsp bouillon powder 400g butternut squash, prepped weight, about half a squash. salt 100g chard 15g coriander 30g roasted & salted peanuts 140g udon noodles 1 lime
Method:
Put a saucepan of salted water on to boil. Pop the other saucepan on a gentle heat and add the sesame oil, Thai curry paste, turmeric and tamari. Cook for 1 min, until it starts to smell fragrant. Add the coconut milk and 300ml water. Bring to a gentle simmer. Add the bouillon powder and stir until dissolved. Cook on a very low simmer while you continue. Peel the squash. Dice into 2cm chunks and add it straight to the coconut milk. Season with a little salt and simmer for 20 mins. Meanwhile, roughly shred the chard, stalks and all. Roughly chop the coriander leaves. Coarsely chop the peanuts. When the laksa has 7 mins left stir the noodles into the pan of boiling water. Cook for 7 mins, until tender (or according to the packet instructions). Meanwhile, add the shredded chard to the laksa for the last few mins to soften and wilt. Drain the noodles and divide between 2 deep bowls. Ladle in the hot laksa, making sure to divide the squash and chard equally. Garnish with the peanuts, coriander and fat wedges of lime for squeezing.
