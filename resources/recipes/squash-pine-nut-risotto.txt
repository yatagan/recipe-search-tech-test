Squash and pine nut risotto
Introduction:
A creamy, comforting autumn's dinner, this is very simple to make but takes a bit of stirring. You can use pumpkin in this recipe instead of squash if that's what you have in your veg box. You could also add a little bacon or pancetta, or fry a few sage leaves in butter and use them as a garnish. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil 40g butter 1 onion, chopped 400g squash, peeled & diced 300g risotto rice 150ml dry white wine 1 tsp saffron threads (optional) 1Â½ litre veg stock 100g Parmesan or vegetarian alternative, grated 4 tbsp pine nuts, lightly toasted salt & pepper
Method:
In a large heavy based saucepan, heat the oil and butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring for 5 minutes. Add the squash, cook for another 2 minutes. Add the rice, stir until translucent. Add the wine. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. If using saffron, in a small heat proof bowl add to 4 tablespoons hot stock, then add to the rice. Continue to add stock gradually, stirring constantly for 20 minutes or so until the rice is tender and creamy, but still with a bit of bite. Add an extra knob of butter, Parmesan cheese and top with toasted pine nuts.
