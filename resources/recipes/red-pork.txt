Red pork
Introduction:
This slow-braised pork belly is one of the glories of China. It calls for little effort, and results in unctuous, ultra-soft meat in a rich, salty sweet sauce. Eat with streamed or boiled rice and braised seasonal greens. Leftovers, should there be any, keep very well for a few days in the fridge and make a wonderful topping for a bowl of noodles. 
Ingredients:
800g pork belly 2cm fresh ginger, peeled & grated 4 garlic cloves, crushed 2 spring onions, trimmed & finely chopped 75ml soy sauce 45ml dry sherry 250ml white wine 2 tbsp brown sugar 1 star anise 500ml chicken or veg stock
Method:
Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Place the pork, rind side up in a casserole dish, then chop, grind and mix the remaining ingredients and pour around the joint. The liquid should rise around to about ¾ of the way up the pork. Put the lid on, bring to the simmer and transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours. Turn the pork over halfway through. A good test for whether it’s cooked is if it is easily pierced with a chopstick. You won’t get crackling, but the gelatin rind will dissolve into the sauce, giving it a delicious unctuous quality. Great with a pile of greens and some mash or rice.
