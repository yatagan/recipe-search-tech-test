Raita
Introduction:
This is designed to soothe your mouth between forkfuls of spicy curry; dairy is a much more effective antidote to chilli heat than a cold drink. It's very quick and simple to make and can be embellished with any fresh herbs you like - coriander works especially well. 
Ingredients:
1 tbsp mustard seeds 300ml thick yoghurt ½ cucumber, peeled & chopped 1 carrot, grated ½ red onion, finely chopped 1 tbsp fresh mint, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Fry the mustard seeds in a little oil until they pop. Add thick yoghurt with the cucumber, carrot, red onion, and chopped mint and some salt and pepper. Serve with curries.
