Squash risotto
Introduction:
Try using the squash seeds and pulp to make a vegetable stock, great for squash soups or added to your risotto stock. Just put the scooped-out seeds and fibres into a pan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 30 minutes, then strain.
Ingredients:
1 medium squash (about 500g), peeled, deseeded & cut into 1cm cubes olive oil 1.5 litres vegetable stock or squash stock (see above) 1 onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 300g risotto rice splash white wine or vermouth 2-3 tbsp butter, to serve 2 tbsp Parmesan, grated, & extra to serve salt & pepper
Method:
Sweat the squash cubes in olive oil in a large covered saucepan until tender (about half an hour). Season. Heat up the stock to simmering point in a pan. In a separate large, heavy-based pan, heat the oil, then add the onion and garlic, and cook gently for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add the rice, stir until well coated and cook gently for a few minutes more. Add the wine or vermouth and cook until absorbed by the rice. Now add squash and stir gently for 2 minutes. Add just enough of the simmering stock to cover the rice and stir well. Keep gradually adding stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly. It’s important to keep the rice at a gentle simmer and allow each addition of stock to be absorbed before adding more. After about 15–18 minutes, when the rice is tender but still has a little bite, remove from the heat. The risotto should be a bit sloppy. Finally mix in the butter and the cheese and serve with more Parmesan for the table.
