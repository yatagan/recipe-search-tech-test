Roasted purple sprouting broccoli with wild garlic butter
Introduction:
Purple sprouting broccoli pairs particularly well with the punchy flavour of wild garlic butter. The butter can also be used with all sorts of veg: melt into wilted spring greens or carrots, or use to top fried mushrooms. It’s good, too, with meat: put a slice on top of steaks, or stuff between the skin and breast of a whole chicken before roasting. 
Ingredients:
1 good handful wild garlic leaves, about 25g, finely chopped juice of ½ lemon 250g butter, left to soften at room temperature 350g purple sprouting broccoli olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Beat the chopped garlic leaves and lemon juice into the butter. Splodge the butter in the middle of some cling film in a rough sausage shape. Roll tightly around the butter and twist it securely at both ends to seal it. Keep in the fridge or freezer, slicing off pieces as you need it. Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Wash the purple sprouting broccoli and leave to dry or pat with kitchen paper (it needs to be dry to roast properly). Arrange on a non-stick baking tray or one lined with baking parchment and toss in just enough olive oil to coat. Season. Roast for 10 minutes, then remove and toss once. Roast for about 10-20 minutes (the cooking time will vary according to the size of the florets). They’ll turn golden brown at the edges and slightly crispy on the outside and just tender inside when ready. Serve with a few thin slices of wild garlic butter on top.
