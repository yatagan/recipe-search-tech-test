Strawberries in balsamic vinegar and orange juice
Introduction:
Macerating strawberries in a bit of sugar and balsamic encourages them to soften and release a delicious fruity syrup. It's a good technique for strawberries that aren't perfectly ripe. With splash of cream this is a splendid summer dessert.

300g strawberries, hulled & halved 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar zest & juice of ½ orange 1-2 tbsp soft brown sugar, to taste cream or crème fraîche, to serve (optional)
Method:
Place the strawberries in a small bowl. Combine balsamic vinegar, orange zest and juice and brown sugar and pour over the strawberries. Leave to marinate in the fridge for up to an hour before serving with cream or crème fraîche.
