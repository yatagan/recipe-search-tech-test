Crispy kale
Introduction:
Kale takes on a deep, savoury, seaweed taste when roasted. Keep an eye on it after the first 5 minutes, a little darkening of the leaves is desirable but be careful that they don’t burn to a cinder. If you have a particularly strong fan in your oven it may blow the kale off the baking tray as it cooks, in which case turn off the fan and adjust the temperature accordingly.
Ingredients:
200g curly kale 2 tbsp sesame oil salt
Method:
Preheat oven to 200˚C/Gas Mark 5. Strip the kale leaves from any large tough stalks, discard the stalks and tear the leaves into bite-sized 3cm pieces. Wash the kale and pat or spin the leaves dry. Mix well with the sesame oil and a good pinch of salt in a roomy bowl, so that all the leaves are coated. Spread the leaves on a baking tray and place in the oven for 8-10 minutes, turning once midway through.
