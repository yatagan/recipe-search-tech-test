Macaroni and broccoli cheese with mustard
Introduction:
Have the best of both worlds with this mac’n’broccoli cheese. It is an unabashedly comforting. The keys to a good white sauce are cooking the flour for a few minutes when you make the roux (flour & butter paste) and making sure the milk is warm when you add it. It helps avoid floury lumps but if you find that your sauce is still a little lumpy you can whizz it with a stick blender or in a processor, or pass it through a fine sieve. 
Ingredients:
500ml milk 1 bay leaf 200g broccoli, cut into 2cm florets 1 tomato, thinly sliced 150g macaroni pasta 25g butter 30g flour 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 100g grated Cheddar 1 nutmeg 40g breadcrumbs
Method:
Fill a saucepan with the milk, bay and 100ml water. Fill another with well salted water. Put them both on the heat. When the milk reaches a simmer, turn it off. When the water is at a rolling boil add the broccoli florets and cook for 3 mins until just tender. Remove the broccoli with a slotted spoon and add the macaroni. Cook for 12 mins until tender. Drain the macaroni well and keep it to one side. Put the oven on 200˚C/180˚C fan/gas 6 to heat up. Melt the butter in a pan. Add the flour to the butter. Beat it together to make a smooth paste. Cook it gently for 3-4 mins until it has a faint biscuity smell. Add half the warm milk. Whisk out any lumps and wait for it to start to thicken. Add the rest of the milk and bring to a gentle simmer. Whisk constantly until you have a smooth thickened sauce. Whisk in the mustard and Cheddar. Finely grate in a little of the nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the macaroni and broccoli to the sauce. Mix together thoroughly and place in an oven tray. Lay the tomato slices on top of the macaroni. Mix the breadcrumbs with 1 tbsp oil and spread over the top. Bake for 20 mins until golden brown.
