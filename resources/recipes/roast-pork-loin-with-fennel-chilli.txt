Roast pork loin with fennel and chilli
Introduction:
Pork and fennel are a traditional Italian pairing, both mild and sweet. The delicious caramelisation they get from roasting is well offset by a little kick of chilli. If you've got celery in your box, you could add it to the bottom of the pan to cook in the pork juices along with or instead of the fennel. 
Ingredients:
1 tsp sea salt 2 tsp dried oregano 2 tsp fennel seeds 1 tsp chilli flakes ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper 1 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1kg pork loin roast 1 large fennel bulb, chopped into 6 wedges olive oil salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 230˚C/Gas 8. To make the spice mix, put the salt, herbs, spices and garlic in a small bowl and stir together. Score the fatty skin of the pork loin (if it is not already done) and pour over a little boiling water to open up the scored cuts, leave to dry and pat the skin completely dry with kitchen paper. In a pan of salted boiling water, blanch the fennel for 5 minutes. Drain, then place in a roasting dish (one just snug enough to fit the pork in). Toss the wedges in the olive oil, season and place the pork loin on top, fat side up. Rub the spice mix all over the meat and skin, making sure it goes into all the scored cuts. Roast for 30 minutes, then turn the heat down to 190˚C/Gas 5 and cook for another 1¼-1½ hours.
