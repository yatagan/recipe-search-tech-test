Pistachio cake
Introduction:
The unlikely combination of polenta, pistachios and olive oil work a treat: this cake is moist but light-as-air, and deliciously nutty. It's makes a very good dessert or accompaniment to coffee. Be careful not to overcook it – it should still have a very slight dampness in the middle when its done. 
Ingredients:
100g butter, melted 125ml olive oil 3 eggs 200g caster sugar juice of 1 orange zest & juice of 1 lemon 50g plain flour 1 tsp baking powder 50g polenta 200g pistachio nuts
Method:
Preheat oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Grease a tart tin. Melt the butter, add the olive oil and leave to cool. Whisk the eggs and sugar and whilst whisking, add the melted butter and olive oil mixture in a thin trickle. To this, add the juice of 1 orange, 1 lemon and its zest. Combine the flour, baking powder, polenta and pistachios and add to the mixture. Mix well and pour into the tin, and cook for around 40 minutes.
