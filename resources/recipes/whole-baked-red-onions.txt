Whole baked red onions
Introduction:
These make a great component in a roast dinner. The flesh turns meltingly soft in the skins, so a whole onion, at least, per person is not a challenge. They can be cooked tucked under your roasting joint instead if the fancy takes you, they’ll soak up all the flavour. These can make a no nonsense starter too, freed from their papery skins and served with some peppery leaf and a crumbly wedge of sharp goat’s cheese. 
Ingredients:
4 red onions light olive oil butter bunch of thyme, rosemary or oregano 1 small glass of wine, red or white 200ml of veg or chicken stock
Method:
Preheat your oven to 200˚C/Gas 6. Cut a slither from the root end of each onion, so as they sit upright in a tight fitting roasting tray. Cut a cross shape, two thirds deep, into the top of each onion. Oil them well and smear some butter into the deep cross you have cut, push some of your chosen herb in too. Season liberally with salt & pepper. Pour in the wine and stock. Cover tightly with foil. Bake for 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake uncovered for a further 15-20 minutes until completely soft in the middle. Peel away the skins and serve with their winey juices.
