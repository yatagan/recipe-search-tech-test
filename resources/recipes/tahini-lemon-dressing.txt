tahini and lemon dressing
Introduction:
Thick, creamy and tangy this simple sauce goes well drizzled over roasted veg or meat, or treated as a dip for warm pittas or crusty bread. For an nutritious packed lunch, use it to dress cooked lentils tossed with finely shredded raw kale or spinach, chopped red pepper and tomatoes, and minced garlic and red onion. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp light tahini (sesame paste) 2 tbsp yoghurt 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp olive oil juice of 1 lemon, to taste salt & pepper
Method:
Stir together the tahini and yoghurt to make a smooth paste. Whisk in the other ingredients with a few tablespoons of water, to get the consistency of pouring cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
