Sumac roasted squash salad
Introduction:
The crown glory of this delectable salad is the dark red Middle Eastern spice, sumac, with a wonderful taste of both paprika and citrus. If you can't find it, replace it with an equal amount of paprika (not smoky) and a good squeeze of lemon. 
Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, peeled, deseeded & sliced into finger-length pieces 1 tsp sumac 2 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 150ml plain yoghurt 100g feta cheese, crumbled 100g salad leaves 50g toasted pistachios 6 fresh mint leaves, shredded salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 180'C/Gas 4. Toss the squash in a baking dish with the sumac and olive oil and season. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, until just tender. Make the dressing: Toast the cumin in a dry frying pan for 1 minute and grind to a powder, then mix in the yoghurt and feta. Toss the salad leaves in a little olive oil to coat and spread over a serving platter. Scatter the squash on top. Drizzle over the yoghurt dressing and sprinkle over the pistachios and mint to serve.
