Portobello mushrooms in red wine with Parmesan polenta
Introduction:
This will serve two as a vegetarian main course, with some salad leaves or wilted greens on the side. As a side dish it will serve four. Be sure to add the polenta steadily and stir continuously for the first 30 seconds or so, to stop any lumps forming. Polenta calls for generous seasoning and plenty of butter and Parmesan, so check it before serving and add to taste. 
Ingredients:
150g polenta (the dry granules, not the quick cook or ready-made variety) 1Â¼ litres water 75g butter 100g Parmesan, grated 1 tbsp olive oil 200g Portobello mushrooms, cleaned & sliced 1 small onion or 1 shallot, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 sprig thyme, leaves only 8 tbsp red wine 4 tbsp veg stock or water salt & pepper
Method:
First make the polenta. Heat the water until it is boiling, then add the polenta in a steady stream, stirring constantly. Add a pinch of salt, turn the heat down to the lowest simmer and let the polenta gently cook for 40 minutes, stirring every now and again to stop it catching on the bottom of the pan. Once it is cooked, stir in 50g of the butter and half of the Parmesan, and check the seasoning. When the polenta is just over halfway through its cooking time, heat the oil and the remaining butter for the mushrooms in a frying pan. Add the onion and cook gently for 10 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for another couple of minutes. Add the mushrooms and thyme leaves and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add the red wine and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until the liquid has reduced slightly. Season to taste. Serve the polenta with the rest of the Parmesan sprinkled over, with the mushrooms piled on top.
