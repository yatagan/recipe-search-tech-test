Leek and tomato crumble
Introduction:
Just as with sweet crumbles, this savoury version is very easy to make. Creamy and juicy, it's a tasty main course with a crisp green salad and a glass of white wine. If you like blue cheese, crumble a little in for added pungency. 
Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil 600g leeks, trimmed & sliced 450g tomatoes, cut into wedges, seeds removed 300ml veg stock 300g cream cheese 1 tsp dried thyme or 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves 150g butter 275g plain flour 150g Cheddar, grated 100g chopped mixed nuts, toasted salt & pepper
Method:
Preheat oven to 190Â°C/Gas 5. In a large pan, heat the oil and gently fry the leeks for 8 minutes, until softened. Add the tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the stock, cream cheese and thyme. Stir to combine, until the cream cheese has melted and you have a creamy sauce. Season to taste and transfer the mixture to a baking dish. In a large bowl, rub together the butter and flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs (or blitz in a food processor). Add the cheese and nuts and sprinkle the mixture over the leeks. Bake for 20-30 minutes until the topping is golden.
