Summer salad

A delightful dog day dish.

200g cherry tomatoes, halved 200g French beans, topped & tailed 100g sugar snap peas, 50g mixed salad leaves 50ml good vinaigrette Slipcote soft sheep's cheese 40g hazelnuts, toasted & chopped handful fresh parsley or chervil, chopped salt & pepper
Method:
You can leave the tomatoes raw but they are lovely slowly cooked at 150˚C/Gas 2 for an hour with oil, salt & pepper. Lightly blanch the French beans in boiling water for 3 minutes and cool in cold water. Drain and slice into thin angled strips. Keep the sugar snaps raw, just remove the stringy edges and cut them in half length-ways along the natural line to reveal the neat row of baby peas. Throw the tomatoes, sugar snap peas and beans with the salad leaves and dressing. Crumble over the sheep’s cheese, hazelnuts and chopped herbs.
