Radicchio and mushroom frittata
Introduction:
Cooked radicchio loses most of its bitterness and makes a good combination with aromatic thyme, pungent blue cheese and meaty mushrooms. Like many egg dishes this is good warm rather than piping hot. It needs nothing more than a green salad for a light vegetarian lunch or dinner. 
Ingredients:
oil for frying, e.g. sunflower or light olive 1 onion, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 200g mushrooms, cleaned & sliced 3 thyme sprigs, leaves only 1 radicchio, shredded 100g blue cheese, crumbled 6 eggs, lightly beaten salt & pepper
Method:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a deep frying pan. Add the onion and fry on a low heat for 8 minutes, stirring now and then to stop it catching. Add the garlic and fry for another 2 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add a splash more oil, turn up the heat and fry the mushrooms and thyme leaves until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the onion back to the pan with the radicchio. Stir until the radicchio has wilted (it will change to a darker reddish brown colour). Season. Stir in the blue cheese. Pour the eggs over the top and tip the pan from side to side so they spread evenly. Cook on a very low heat until the frittata is about two thirds set on the bottom. Finish under a medium grill until the top is just set. Serve warm, cut into wedges.
