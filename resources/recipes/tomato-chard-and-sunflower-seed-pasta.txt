Tomato, chard and sunflower seed pasta
Introduction:
This is a healthy, dairy-free pasta – the creamy sunflower seed paste holds together the tastes instead. We harvest chard from June to November, which coincides with our June to mid-October tomato season. 
Ingredients:
300g fresh chard 85g sunflower seeds 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely sliced 900g fresh tomatoes, peeled & seeded 2 tbsp tomato purée 1 tbsp fresh oregano, chopped 1 tbsp fresh basil, chopped 400g linguine (or other pasta) salt & pepper
Method:
Wash the chard, remove ribs and cut across in 1 inch ribbons. Sauté the sunflower seeds until light brown then grind half of them in a food processor, nut or coffee grinder until fine. Reserve the remaining half for garnish. Heat the oil in a pan, adding the onion and cooking until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato purée, ground sunflower seeds, herbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Steam the chard for about 5 minutes until tender. Cook the pasta according to packet instruction, then toss with the sauce and garnish with the remaining seeds.
