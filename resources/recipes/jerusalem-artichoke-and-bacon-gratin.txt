Jerusalem artichoke & bacon gratin
Introduction:
This creamy gratin is particularly good for busy weeknights, as Jerusalem artichokes cook quickly on the stove. Then the dish only needs a blast under a hot grill to finish it off. It still works well if you leave out the bacon. It is rich, so it's good for a side dish for 2-4, depending how hungry you are and what else you're planning on serving. For an indulgent supper that's not too much in quantity, a crisp green salad alongside will do the job for two. 
Ingredients:
75g smoked bacon, diced 25g butter 200g Jerusalem artichokes, scrubbed clean 100ml double cream 100ml milk 20g Parmesan, grated salt & pepper
Method:
Heat the grill to high. Fry the bacon in the butter until crispy. Drain on kitchen paper and set aside. Peel and slice the artichokes and put them in a small pan with the cream and milk. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until tender but still holding their shape, about 10 mins. Drain the artichokes and put the liquid back on to the stove to reduce. When thickened to a custard consistency, return the artichokes to the pan, add the bacon and season to taste. Tip into a gratin dish and top with the Parmesan. Place under the hot grill until golden, 5â€“10 mins.
