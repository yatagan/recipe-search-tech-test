Mushroom and Madeira soup with thyme and truffle oil
Introduction:
A creamy vegetarian soup bursting with earthy flavour. This calls for a few special ingredients, but if you don't have Madeira, sherry is a decent substitute; and though truffle oil makes the soup extra nice it isn't essential. Even more depth of flavour is given by 10g of dried porcini, soaked in water for 5 minutes then added with the fresh mushrooms. 
Ingredients:
1 small onion, finely chopped 1-2 leeks, white part only, finely sliced 4 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, chopped 450-500g mushrooms, wiped & roughly sliced Â½ tsp nutmeg, ground or grated leaves of 3 sprigs thyme 800ml chicken or veg stock 100-150ml Madeira, to taste 100-150ml double cream handful fresh parsley, finely chopped few drops truffle oil (optional) salt & pepper
Method:
In a large pan, sweat the onion and leeks in the olive oil until soft. Add the garlic and mushrooms, cook until mushrooms are soft and reduced. Add the nutmeg and thyme and cook for another minute. Blend or process the mushroom mix with a ladle of stock until smooth. Return to the pan, add the remaining stock, Madeira and half the cream. Reheat the soup and season. Adjust the thickness with more cream or water to taste. Stir in the chopped parsley. Serve with a further swirl of cream if you like and a few drops of truffle oil if using.
