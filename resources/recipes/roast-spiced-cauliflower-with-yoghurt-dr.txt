Roast spiced cauliflower with yoghurt dressing
Introduction:
A quick roasting intensifies cauliflower's nuttiness. With its Indian-spiced yoghurt marinade this recipe manages to get a huge amount of flavour out of only a few ingredients. As ever with cauliflower, blanch the florets only briefly or you'll risk them getting soggy and tasteless. 
Ingredients:
1 cauliflower, separated into florets 1 tbsp olive oil 1½ tsp ground cumin 1½ tsp ground coriander ½ tsp ground black pepper salt 4 tbsp plain yoghurt, creamy if possible 1 tbsp olive oil 1 garlic clove, crushed juice of ½ lemon, or more to taste handful fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Boil the cauliflower florets for a couple of minutes in salted water, so they are not quite raw but not soft. Toss in the oil, then combine the spices and salt in a bowl and roll the cauliflower in the mix to coat. Transfer the florets to a roasting tray and cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until tender. Combine all the remaining ingredients except the coriander to make the dressing, and pour over the slightly cooled cauliflower. Finish with a sprinkling of chopped coriander.
