Tuna, purple sprouting broccoli and quinoa salad with lemon and dill dressing
Introduction:
A light, nutritious meal. Apart from the broccoli and tomatoes, this is pretty much made from the store cupboard, so it's great for last minute cooking. It's sturdy enough to make the night before for an excellent packed lunch. Although purple sprouting works best here, you can also make this with normal broccoli. 
Ingredients:
100g quinoa 200g purple sprouting broccoli juice of Â½-1 lemon, to taste 3 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil 1 tbsp capers 4 tomatoes, cut into wedges 4 tbsp fresh parsley & dill, chopped 1 can tuna, drained & crumbled (about 125-130g drained weight) a little olive or rapeseed oil, for drizzling
Method:
Put the quinoa in a pan of boiling water (you want about 2-3 times the volume of water to quinoa) and simmer for 15 minutes. Drain and leave to cool. In another pan of boiling water, cook the purple sprouting broccoli for 3-4 minutes, until just tender but still with some bite. Drain and toss in the lemon juice, oil and capers. Leave to cool slightly, then add the quinoa and the rest of the ingredients, bar the tuna. Put into a serving dish, crumble over the tuna and drizzle with a little oil to serve.
