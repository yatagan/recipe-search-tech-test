Frying steak sandwich
Introduction:
There are sandwiches for picnics and sandwiches that constitute a whole meal; this is definitely one of the latter. If you are feeling lazy a coating of mayonnaise on one side and Dijon mustard on the other is much better than OK, but making a herb butter in advance raises the bar to another level. This recipe works best if the beef is cut into 2.5cm strips and tapped out with a rolling pin to an even thickness of about 4mm. 
Ingredients:
250g frying steak olive oil 1 ciabatta or baguette bunch watercress for the herb butter: 50g warm butter ½ lemon 2 tbsp parsley, chopped ½ garlic clove, crushed to a paste with a little sea salt 1 tsp Dijon mustard
Method:
Mash the butter and flavourings together with a fork. Put the steak on a chopping board, then season and brush both sides with a little olive oil. Heat a griddle pan to a moderate heat, split the bagueete in half lengthways and warm through (a slight crunch isn't a bad thing). Quickly griddle the steaks and spread the warm bread with herb butter. The extra butter can be melted on the steaks in the pan. Lay out the bread, put the steak on one half and pour the butter and juices on top. Add the watercress and second half of bread, press lightly and eat immediately.
