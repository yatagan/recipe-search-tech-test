Pork casserole with milk & fennel
Introduction:
One of the joys of starting with a big chunk of meat is that you can dice it by hand to the size you like. You definitely need big (3cm) dice for this dish. This is delicious with potatoes in parchment, and some seasonal greens. 
Ingredients:
1.2kg pork joint 4 tbsp olive oil 3 tbsp coarsely ground fennel seeds 6 garlic cloves 3 heads fennel, cut into 6 or 8 wedges each zest of 1 lemon large bunch fresh parsley, chopped
Method:
Remove the pork from its netting and cut into large 3cm dice, discarding the rind. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and quickly brown half the meat. Transfer to a casserole or slow cooker and repeat with the other half. Add the fennel seeds and garlic. Keep it on the move for a few seconds and add a couple of tablespoons of water. Scrape around with a wooden spoon to deglaze and pour/spoon into the casserole or slow cooker. Add the milk, cream and lemon juice to the pork and, if you are casseroling, bring up to temperature and transfer to the oven (on minimum setting – about 120°C/Gas ½). If you are using a slow cooker, switch it on high. Add the rest of the oil to the pan and over a medium heat, brown the wedges of fennel on all sides. Don’t err on the side of caution; brown them well then put to one side. Leave for an hour. Add the fennel wedges to the casserole, push down to submerge and return to the oven. Cook for about four hours, remove from the oven and remove the pork and fennel with a slotted spoon. Pour the liquid through a sieve, pushing through with the back of a wooden spoon, return to the pan and reduce by half. Add the lemon zest and parsley and pour over the pork and fennel.
