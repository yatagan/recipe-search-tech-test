Stoved Jerusalem artichokes
Introduction:
Easy once mastered, this method of steaming then frying Jerusalem artichokes concentrates their delicate taste and gives then a golden-brown crust. The same technique can be used with turnips, carrots and potatoes. This vegetarian dish could be served alone as a canapé, or as a side with anything from roast beef to fish or chicken. 
Ingredients:
1kg Jerusalem artichokes grated zest & juice of ½ lemon 1 tbsp olive oil 25g butter 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped 1 large garlic clove, chopped
Method:
Peel and cut the artichokes in halves or quarters if they are large - the pieces should be about the size of a quail's egg or slightly larger, give or take the odd corner. Drop the artichokes into water acidulated with the lemon juice as you work , to prevent browning. Drain and dry the artichokes. Heat the oil and butter in a wide frying-pan over a low to moderate heat, until foaming. Tip the artichokes into the fat in a single layer. If you have too many and they are hopelessly heaped up, you'll need to use a second pan, or cook them in batches. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or so, occasionally shaking the pan gently. Check after 5 minutes and turn them over carefully. After 10 minutes, remove the cover. The artichokes should be beginning to brown. Cook for a further 10 minutes until they are tender, turning occasionally, so that they colour evenly. While they cook, chop the parsley, garlic and lemon zest together very finely to make a 'gremolata'. When cooked, season the Jerusalem artichokes with salt and pepper and sprinkle over the gremolata.
