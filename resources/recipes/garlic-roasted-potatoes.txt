Garlic roasted potatoes
Introduction:
Oven-roasted potatoes are a simple crowd-pleaser and go well with all types of roast meat. If you don't serve all the roasted garlic cloves with the potatoes, keep some (or make extra) and use to flavour mashed potatoes or soup, or spread on bruschetta with some roasted veg or purple sprouting broccoli. 
Ingredients:
1.5kg potatoes â€“ if you have small ones, scrub well & leave in their skins, or peel & cut into quarters lengthways 6 tbsp sunflower oil 1 tbsp walnut oil cloves from 2 garlic bulbs sea salt, to season
Method:
Boil the potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain. Heat the oils in a roasting tin or baking dish in the oven for a few minutes. Add the potatoes and garlic, toss in the oil and season well with sea salt. Roast for about 40 minutes, until the potatoes are tender inside. Serve with the garlic cloves, leave whole or squeeze over the potatoes before serving.
