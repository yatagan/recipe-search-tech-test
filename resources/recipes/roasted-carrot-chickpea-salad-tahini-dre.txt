Roasted carrot and chickpea salad with tahini dressing
Introduction:
Zinging with spices, nutty with tahini, this carrot and chickpea salad is complex, delicious and healthy. You can also make this with cubes of squash, sweet potato or other roots. Garnish it with a lot of chopped parsley if you've got it, and also with crumbled feta if you want a bit more saltiness. Eat alone as a packed lunch or light dinner, or with warm pitta or lamb kebabs. 
Ingredients:
600g carrots, peeled & cut into large chunks 2 tbsp olive oil ½ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 tsp cumin seeds ½ tsp ground coriander ¼ tsp smoked paprika 1 tbsp clear honey 100g mixed salad leaves 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed & drained for the dressing: 2 tbsp light tahini 2 tbsp plain yogurt 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 tbsp olive oil juice of 1 lemon
Method:
Preheat oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Toss the carrots in a baking dish with the oil, chilli, cumin, coriander and paprika. Season and roast for 30-40 minutes, until tender. Remove from the oven and toss in the chickpeas, coating them with the spices. Drizzle over the honey, and leave to cool slightly. Scatter the salad, chickpeas and carrots over a large serving plate. Make the dressing: stir the tahini with the yogurt until you have a smooth paste. Whisk in the rest of the ingredients with a few tablespoons of water, just enough so the dressing has the consistency of pouring cream. Drizzle over the salad.
