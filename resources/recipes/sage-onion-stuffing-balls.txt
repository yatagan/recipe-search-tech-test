Sage and onion stuffing balls
Introduction:
This traditional stuffing goes with chicken, game and pork. Despite the dictates of tradition, never stuff your bird – it will slow down the cooking resulting in over-done breast meat. Cook the balls in a separate dish – which has the added advantage that the stuffing gets nice and crispy, and that vegetarians can eat it too. Good additions to this basis recipe: dried chopped prunes or apricots, walnuts, hazelnuts or pine nuts. 
Ingredients:
6 thick slices dry bread 1 onion, peeled & roughly chopped 12-15 sage leaves 25g butter, chilled & diced 1 egg salt & pepper
Method:
Tear up the bread slices and put them in a food processor together with chopped onion, sage leaves, diced butter and pulse a few times (don’t over-process the stuffing mixture or the onion will taste bitter and the texture will be lost to a purée) then add seasoning and egg for a final pulse. Take small handfuls and fashion lightly into balls the size of large walnuts. Sit in an oven proof dish and bake for 20-30 minutes.
