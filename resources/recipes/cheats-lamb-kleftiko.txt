Cheat’s lamb kleftiko
Introduction:
Apparently kleftiko was the name given to a dish made from rustled (stolen) lamb; leg of lamb is the norm, but diced will do. Wrapping potatoes in parchment is an old Field Kitchen favourite and it’s even better with the lamb. It also seals in the cooking smells so the thieves wouldn’t get caught.
Ingredients:
1 pepper, in 2-3cm chunks 2 red onions, cut into 8 wedges each 440g diced lamb 40ml olive oil zest & juice of ½ lemon 1 heaped tsp Dijon mustard 2 garlic cloves, crushed & chopped 1 tsp dried oregano 5 medium waxy potatoes 50g feta cheese salt & pepper
Method:
Put the pepper, onions, lamb, olive oil, and lemon juice in a bowl. Add the mustard, the garlic, lemon zest, a sprinkle of oregano and season with salt and pepper. Mix everything together. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinade for an hour or so. Preheat oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Peel the potatoes and cut to roasting size. Lay a couple of sheets of baking paper in a small roasting tray. Put the potatoes on the paper and season with salt and a pinch of oregano. Pour the marinade from the lamb over the potatoes and put the lamb and vegetables on top. Fold the sides of the paper into a pouch. Fold over the top and seal (a stapler is the easiest and most effective method). Bake the parcel on the tray in the oven for about an hour. Remove the tin from the oven and increase the temperature to 220°C/ Gas 7. Cut off the seal (including staples) and fold back the parchment paper. Baste the lamb with the juices, crumble over the feta and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes until everything begins to brown. Serve with salad and minty yoghurt (both Greek, but not stolen).
