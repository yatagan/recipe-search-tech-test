Cucumber and dill salad
Introduction:
A crisp, tangy summer salad, this is good with barbecues, or with smoked salmon, grilled fish or lamb chops. If you like raw onions, thinly slice a red one and add it to the mix. 
Ingredients:
1 cucumber, very thinly sliced Â½ tbsp caster sugar 1 tbsp boiling water 2 tbsp white wine vinegar 1-2 salad onions, finely chopped (use 1 shallot when available) handful dill, finely chopped salt & pepper
Method:
Arrange the cucumber in layers in a colander placed over a large bowl, sprinkling each layer of cucumber with salt. Put another bowl on top that fits well into the colander and weigh it down with a heavy cook book or a couple of food tins. Leave for an hour. Remove the weights and top bowl and put in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour. To make the dressing, dissolve the caster sugar in the boiling water then add the vinegar, onion and dill. Mix, then leave to cool. When ready to serve, remove the cucumber from the fridge, drain off any extra liquid, then toss with the dill dressing and serve.
